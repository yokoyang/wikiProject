Mary L. Fonseca

Mary L. Fonseca (1915–2005) was a Massachusetts state senator who represented the Second Bristol District from 1953 to 1984. As Assistant Majority Leader, she was the first woman to hold a leadership post in the Massachusetts Senate. 

Fonseca was known as a strong supporter of working women and public education. In her first senate speech, she successfully argued for an end to discrimination against women teachers in Massachusetts public schools. 

She was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, the daughter of Mary Botelho and José Leite, both Portuguese immigrants. Her father owned a small grocery store on the corner of Webster and Alden Streets. After graduating from Durfee High School in 1932, she wanted to go to college but, as she explained in an interview, "as the oldest girl in a family of 12, I had to go right to work." She worked at the Fall River Public Library, and later as a secretary for the U.S. Census Bureau.

She first became interested in politics as a teenager, when she accompanied her mother to meetings of the Portuguese-American Civic League. Soon she began taking part in the League's fundraising drives, and organized a Junior Council for young members.

She was elected to the Fall River School Committee in 1945 and served two four-year terms. During her last year on the committee she served as vice chairman. Concerned about rising unemployment in her area, she successfully ran for state senate in 1952, running a low-budget campaign out of her family's modest third-floor apartment. She was the first woman to represent the Second Bristol District in the senate, the first Portuguese-American woman elected to the Massachusetts Senate, and possibly the first Portuguese-American woman to be elected to any legislative seat in the United States. As Assistant Majority Leader (or Majority Whip) from 1973 to 1984, she was also the first woman to hold a leadership post in the Massachusetts senate.

Fonseca earned a reputation as a champion of women and public education. In her "maiden speech" on the senate floor, she argued in support of a bill ending discrimination against married women teachers:

There are only two bachelors and three women in the Massachusetts State Senate. That means out of 40 senators, 35 of you are going to have to make a determination before we leave here today as to whether or not your wives became less competent the day they married you. When a male teacher gets married, his pay is not lowered, nor are his annual leave and pension rights taken from him, yet there is a double standard where women are concerned. Why?

After having been voted down repeatedly for years, the bill finally passed. Fonseca went on to chair the Senate Committee on Education, and was a strong supporter of Southeastern Massachusetts University (now the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth) and Bristol Community College in Fall River. In 1974 she successfully argued in favor of tax deductions for working mothers' daycare expenses.

She married John C. Fonseca Jr., an insurance company employee, in 1948. The couple had two children, John and Irene. Her husband died in 1970.

She was active in many civic and charitable organizations, including the Business and Professional Women's Foundation, the National Order of Women Legislators, the Portuguese-American Civic League, the Salvation Army Women's Auxiliary, and the Holy Name Women.

Towards the end of her life Fonseca suffered from Alzheimer's disease. She died of a heart attack in the County Gardens Nursing Home in Swansea, Massachusetts. Mary L. Fonseca Elementary School in Fall River is named in her honor.

The Highwaymen (film)

The Highwaymen is an upcoming American drama film directed by John Lee Hancock, written by John Fusco, and starring Kevin Costner and Woody Harrelson. It is set to be released on October 19, 2018 on Netflix.

"The Highwaymen" follows Texas Ranger Frank Hamer and ex-partner Maney Gault. "The lawmen were out of the Rangers by the time Bonnie & Clyde started their robbery reign, but were commissioned as special investigators, coaxed by a consortium of banks to assemble a posse and end the robbery spree of the notorious gang reputed to have killed 13 cops and others."


Around 2005, producer Casey Silver began to develop "The Highwaymen" an original pitch from John Fusco that once had Paul Newman and Robert Redford poised to play the veteran Texas Rangers who put an end to the violent robbery spree of Bonnie and Clyde. The project had been a long-time goal of Fusco's to portray Texas Ranger Frank Hamer in the proper light of history. Fusco researched extensively in Texas and became friends with Hamer's son, the late Frank Hamer Jr. By 2013, the project was under development at Universal Pictures.

On June 21, 2017, it was reported that Netflix was in negotiations to extricate the production from Universal Pictures. At the time of the report, Netflix was in early discussions with Woody Harrelson and Kevin Costner for the two lead roles and with John Lee Hancock as director. The script was written by John Fusco and rewritten by Hancock. Casey Silver, who had been developing the project while it was at Universal, was set to produce.

On February 12, 2018, it was announced by Netflix that the film had entered production. Hancock was officially confirmed as director, and Harrelson, Costner, and Silver were confirmed as producers. They are set to produce alongside Michael Malone and Rod Lake. The production reportedly has a budget of around $49 million.

Alongside the announcement of the film entering production, it was confirmed that Costner and Harrelson would be playing Frank Hamer and Maney Gault, respectively. In addition, it was announced that Kathy Bates, John Carroll Lynch, Kim Dickens, Thomas Mann, and William Sadler had also joined the cast.

The film entered into principal photography on February 12, 2018 in New Orleans, Louisiana. Filming there is expected to last until April 10, 2018. The production is set to film in other locations around the state including Covington, LaPlace, Hammond, Baton Rouge, and Donaldsonville. On February 21, 2018, filming took place at Laurel Valley Plantation in Thibodaux, Louisiana. The production moved to Donaldsonville, Louisiana where filming took place through February 26, 2018 and where it reportedly shut down an area of the town’s historic district. On March 5, 2018, filming occurred at the Old Louisiana Governor's Mansion in Baton Rouge. Production reportedly caused streets surrounding the to be blocked off for the majority of the day. From March 21 to 25, 2018, filming took place on Highway 154. Reportedly, the production was reenacting the killing of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow near where the actual event took place. To recreate the scene on what is now an asphalt two-lane highway, the film crew planted trees along the right-of-way and added dirt to cover the blacktop road. Later that month, filming took place on an old U.S. Route 380 bridge that sits southwest of Newcastle, Texas crossing the Brazos River. Principal photography for the film concluded on March 29, 2018 in Shreveport, Louisiana.

FIS Ski Jumping Europa Cup

The FIS Ski Jumping Europa Cup was a series of ski jumping competitions arranged yearly by the International Ski Federation. Prior to the formation of theContinental Cup in 1993, the Europa Cup served as the second level of international ski jumping, ranking below the World Cup. Athletes competing in the Europa Cup were usually juniors and jumpers fighting for a spot on their nation's World Cup team. Often some World Cup athletes would also compete in the Europa Cup inbetween World Cup events.

The International Ski Federation considers the last two Europa Cup seasons in 1991/92 and 1992/93 where they competed only in Europe and with only European ski jumpers, as first two Continental Cup seasons. Starting from the 1993/94 season the Continental Cup was officially started with events in North America and Asia and the Europa Cup was absorbed in the new Continental Cup as a result.

Some Somali restaurants serve it with a banana. This rice dish is often served from a clay pot called "baris dhari", which serves to impart flavor from food cooked in metal pots.

I'll Be Your Girl

I'll Be Your Girl is the eighth studio album by the American indie rock band The Decemberists, released on March 16, 2018 on Capitol and Rough Trade. Produced by John Congleton, the band experimented with new instrumentation during the album's recording sessions, including several synth-based compositions inspired by New Order and Depeche Mode. The album was preceded by the singles, "Severed" and "Once in My Life".

The album's lyrical content was, in part, influenced by the US 2016 presidential election and its immediate aftermath. Vocalist and guitarist Colin Meloy noted: "["I'll Be Your Girl"] celebrates the absurdity of our current predicaments. I think it really is a reflection of my outlook immediately post the 2016 election, where there was immediately this onset of despair. Like real despair. Real depression, and then sort of climbing out of it. Seeing other people feeling the same way, similarly climbing out of their hole and just witnessing events as they came along, rather than with tears. There was almost like an ironic humour but with anger, and those sort of go together. It was about finding the balance between real rage and humour – discovering the wild absurdity in it, but not being blithe."

WarGames (interactive media)


Narratively, the show follows a young group of people that are involved in the hacker culture, attempting to use their skills to create societial change. Interactively, the viewer is presented with several video feeds, representing what each of the characters is watching or doing, and can choose which one to focus on; this will affect how the work is presented to the viewer later, though will otherwise not change the narrative.

MGM's 1983 film "WarGames" was both a critical and financial success for the distributor. While the studio attempted a sequel, "" in 2008, the work ended up going direct-to-video. In June 2011, MGM announced plans to remake "WarGames". At the time, this move was seen as a way by MGM to capitalize on its highly-successful library of films from the 1980s. Seth Gordon was originally slated to direct with Noah Oppenheim to write the script. In June 2014, Dean Israelite had been hired to produce the work, and with potentially Arash Amel slated to write the screenplay. As late as February 2015, Israelite was still working on the project which was still in its scripting phase, but by April 2015, Israelite had been picked up for producer of "Power Rangers", lead to concern for his participation for "WarGames".

By October 2015, the project had shifted to become an interactive media work, co-produced by MGM and Interlude (the former name of Eko), with plans to release by early 2016. The move was seen as experimental by MGM, as the work would forgo any theatrical release or revenues, though could still be monetized depending on how the interactive work was presented to viewers. They saw an "audience-driven interactive story experience" as a perfect fit for the "WarGames" property. Shortly after this announcement, MGM invested heavily into Interlude, which had raised from investors including MGM, Warner Music Group, Samsung, Sequoia Capital and Intel Capital.

Around March 2016, Interlude hired Sam Barlow as executive creative director and creative lead for the "WarGames" project. Barlow had gained attention in 2015 for his video game "Her Story", which required players to piece together a narrative by assembling segments of video footage in the right order. "Her Story" received critical acclaim on its release. Barlow said of the opportunity with Interlude to work alongside people that wanted to make "personalized, reactive stories with a heightened emotional impact".

By December 2017, MGM announced that the interactive media series would be called "#WarGames" with an anticipated start in early 2018. By February, Eko confirmed that the series would be six episodes long, and would be broadcast with interactivity on its own website, mobile app, Nerdist.com<ref>

The Civil Air Patrol Quonset Huts were three Quonset huts located at 16601 Airport Road in Lansing, Michigan, near Capital Region International Airport. The huts were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, and are part of the Historic American Engineering Record. The huts are missing and presumed demolished.

These Quonset hits were manufactured by the Butler Manufacturing Company and shipped to Lansing in 1941. They were set up at this location in November, 1941 to house the newly established 9622nd USAF Reserve Recovery Unit. Soon after, the Civil Air Patrol was established, and the Lansing unit began using the huts. For the remainder of World War II, the Lansing Quonset huts were used as a pilot training facility for both the Civil Air Patrol and the USAF Reserve Recovery Unit. The three huts were used continually after the war until 1958, when they were dismantled and put into storage in response to a perceived military threat to the airport. However, the huts were put back into service in 1963, and were used until at least the early 1990s, despite planned demolition in the 1980s.

However, by 1995, the huts were deemed as airport hazards by the Federal Aviation Administration and vacated. Demolition was scheduled at that time.

The three Quonset huts sat side-by-side. All three were constructed from prefabricated corrugated steel panels placed horizontally over arched steel ribs and purloins. The huts were eighteen by forty-eight feet, with a center height of eleven feet. Each hut had a single door on the end, and eight windows, four on each side, measuring 31 by 39 inches. The windows were hinged at the top of the frame and open from the bottom.

The Organisation of European Cancer Institutes (OECI) is an international non-profit organization with European Economic Interest Grouping status. It was created in 1979 to promote greater cooperation among European Cancer Centres and Institutes. The organisation’s head office is located in Brussels at the University Foundation.

OECI’s mission is to give to all European cancer patients the possibility of receiving the best available care. It is a network of almost 100 institutions across Europe.
Quality improvement in Cancer Care and Research

In analogy to the NCI's network of designated comprehensive and clinical cancer centers, OECI has developed an Accreditation and Designation Programme. Its goal is to improve our cancer centres’ organisation. More then 50% of the OECI Members are included in the A&D Programme.
The OECI quality approach is now recognised as the only existing European process specifically designed for cancer centres. Moreover in 2017 the OECI Standards implemented in the accreditation programme obtained itself ISQua Accreditation. ISQua is the umbrella organization responsible for accrediting the Joint Commission International accreditation and other international accreditation schemes.

A rigorous and independent methodology

OECI is the main European network of accredited cancer centres on a European scale. It plays a role in helping EU Member State authorities to organise their cancer health care systems.

Miniature Train at Monarch Park

The Miniature Train at Monarch Park was a gauge miniature railway at Oil City, Pennsylvania around 1901. 

The park’s Miniature Train was hauled by a steam locomotive, which was built like a standard trunk line steam locomotive. The locomotive and its tender were scale models, the passenger cars were open-air. In making its rounds, it stopped periodically to replenish coal and water. Among the engineers were Charlie Thomas, Dick O’Neil, and a person of short stature named George Hawks, who was very popular with his passengers. The trains ran on a circular track laid with T-rails spiked to miniature sleepers.

The lilliputian locomotive was made around 1901 by the Armitage-Herschell Company in North Tonawanda, New York, when miniature railways were coming into favour. Their locomotives could pull up to 10 passenger cars, having seating capacity for 40 children or 20 
adults. The locomotive was a facsimile of the regular type of passenger steam locomotives.

Ministry of the Navy (Turkey)

The Ministry of the Navy () was a former government ministry in Turkey. During the first two governments of Turkey the naval affairs were managed by a directorate. But on 22 November 1924 during the formation of the 3rd government of Turkey a new ministry was established for the naval affairs. However soon the ministry was blamed for a chain of accidents during the maintenance of the battle cruiser Yavuz. The minister was put on trial and the ministry was abolished at the end of the 4th government of Turkey on 1 November 1927. The responsibility of the ministry was transferred to the Ministry of National Defense. 

On 6 July 2011, during the formation of the 61st government of Turkey the name of the ministry of "Transport and Communication" was changed to Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication, but this ministry is responsible only in civilian maritime affairs.

Love in a Cold Climate (TV serial, 1980)

"Love in a Cold Climate" is a television serial made by Thames Television in 1980, starring Lucy Gutteridge, Rosalyn Landor, Michael Aldridge, Judi Dench, Vivian Pickles, and Jean-Pierre Cassel.

It is an adaptation of the Nancy Mitford novels "Love in a Cold Climate" and "The Pursuit of Love", set between 1924 and 1940, with a screenplay by Simon Raven, and was originally broadcast on the ITV network in eight episodes.

The filming of the serial has been described as "most uncharacteristically relaxed" for the actors, as it had been scheduled during what proved to be a long-running dispute between ITV and the Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians union. At first, there was a work-to-rule, and the actors were not called until 11 am, with filming ending at about 4 pm. The dispute then escalated into a full strike, and filming was abandoned, with the actors being paid a retainer until it could be started again.

Enamel fracture

Enamel Fracture is a complete fracture of the tooth enamel without the involvement of the dentine and pulp. Pulp sensibility testing is recommended to confirm pulpal health. Treatment depends on the size of the fractures. If a tooth fragment is still available, it can be bonded to the tooth. For small or minor fractures, it can be smoothed to remove rough margins and edges. For a larger or major fractures, dental composite resin can be used to mask the defective enamel for aesthetic purpose.

Reckless Love (Cory Asbury album)

Reckless Love is the second solo studio album by American Christian worship musician Cory Asbury, and his third album overall. Bethel Music released the album on January 26, 2018, his first full-length release with the label. Asbury worked with Jason Ingram and Paul Mabury in the production of the album.

Preceded by the release of the album's popular title track as a single in October 2017, "Reckless Love" debuted at No. 1 on "Billboard"'s Christian Albums chart in the United States, this being his first appearance on the chart.

Cory Asbury started out as a worship leader with the International House of Prayer in Kansas City from 2005 and appeared on several IHOP-KC releases. He released a duet album with Matt Gilman titled "Holy" in 2008, followed by his solo debut called "Let Me See Your Eyes" in 2009 via the IHOP-affiliated label, Forerunner Music. In 2012, Cory Asbury moved from Kansas City to Colorado Springs, Colorado to join New Life Church as worship pastor where he served as a worship leader with New Life Worship and Desperation Band. He featured on New Life Worship's "Strong God" (2013), and co-wrote some songs on "Banner" (2014) as a Desperation Band member.

Asbury joined the Bethel Music collective in May 2015 and made his first appearance on a Bethel Music collective release performing the song "Son of God" on their eighth live album, "Have It All" (2016). In December 2016, he moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan to serve as a worship pastor of Radiant Church. After a nine-year solo hiatus, he released "Reckless Love" in January 2018, an album that is described as "a whole-hearted telling of an essential story in Scripture: a Father's desire for connection with the ones he made, knows, and relentlessly loves." The album is said to have been inspired by the lessons that Asbury learnt in his journey from boyhood to manhood.

In a post on Bethel Music's Instagram page regarding the cover art for the album and the single, Cory Asbury expressed that he had to become a father to learn how to become a son. He shared that the cover of the single "Reckless Love" signified an introduction to his personal story, saying "The beginning. The genesis. An innocent little boy with goofy, spiky hair and not a care in the world. Just a little kid. A son. No worries. No wounds. Carefree and confident in the perfect little world my parents provided for me." Asbury then stated that the album cover denotes his life coming full circle, saying:

On the journey from boyhood to manhood there were a million cracks in the road. But somehow the grace of God swooped in with wings otherworldly and carried me safely over each one. And finally, those mighty wings set me down in a broad place. Now I'm a father to my own little boy. And somehow, in so becoming, I'm a little child again. Fully free and fully alive in my Father's eyes. The brokenness didn't break me. No, we rewrote the story in crimson ink. And I dance again like a little boy. Nothing between us. Innocent and free just like You always wanted. And I realize I've always been the dream of Your heart. A son.

— Cory Asbury, via Bethel Music's Instagram feed
Bethel Music announced the commencement of the album's pre-order period on January 5, 2018, with "Endless Alleluia", "Reckless Love" and "Water and Dust" being released as promotional singles as they were availed for instant download.

Cory Asbury released "Reckless Love" via Bethel Music on October 27, 2017 as the lead single from the album. A version of "Reckless Love" adapted for radio airplay was released in digital format on January 5, 2018. Three weeks prior to its impact date, the song was already spinning on radio stations across the United States.

Reviewing for Eden.co.uk, Aaron Lewendon concluded that "Through "Reckless Love", God's strength is liked not to a celestial force, but to the limitless resolve of the most loving of parents. It's a love that conquers death, that brings freedom, and that brings the one thing we've been searching all our lives for; security." Timothy Yap, reviewing the album for Hallels whilst rating it three-point-five-out-of-five, believes that "the album abounds with great worship moments." Jay Wright of NewReleaseToday concluded in his review of the album: "Every word and every line Cory Asbury sings in Reckless Love resonates with the warm and gentle love of God. Cory describes our Father as One who is passionate and will stop at nothing to win our hearts. Serene melodies mix with stunning harmonies to bring an album that invites the listener to sit back and simply receive God's unending love. Reckless Love has certainly been worth the wait!"

In the United States, the week ending February 1, 2018 saw "Reckless Love" garnering sales of 11,000 equivalent album units, and as a result topping the Billboard Christian Albums chart. "Reckless Love" is Cory Asbury's debut album on the Christian albums chart and his first No. 1 release on the chart. The album was also the fifth best-selling digital album in the same week, attained No. 4 on the Independent Albums chart, whilst registering on the all-inclusive "Billboard" 200 chart at No. 53. 

In Australia, "Reckless Love" debuted at No. 69 in the week ending February 4, 2018 on the ARIA Albums Chart. 

"Reckless Love" also became Cory Asbury's chart-topping debut on the OCC's Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart for the best-selling releases of the genre in the United Kingdom, achieving the No. 1 spot in the week ending February 8, 2018.

Church of Santa Maria Avvocata

The Church of Santa Maria Avvocata is a Catholic church located at the end of Via Avvocata in Piazza Dante in the Historic Center of Naples, Italy.

The church building dates back to the 16th century, when the Carmelite priest Alessandro Mollo built a church with a small convent. By the end of the century, Cardinal Alfonso Gesualdo, the Archbishop of Naples, had purchased the complex and raised it to the status of a parish church.

In the subsequent centuries, the church was remodeled in the Baroque style common to many of the churches in Naples. The facade was re-designed by Domenico Antonio Vaccaro with stucco.

The center of the parish was then moved from Santa Maria Avvocata to the nearby Church of San Domenico Soriano.

The nave is bright and full of decorations and festoons. Its plan is rectangular and the high altar is made of multicolored marble. The design of the interior is similar to that of the nearby Church of Sant'Antonio a Tarsia. Several frescoes inside are by Luca Giordano and Vincenzo Galloppi.

On the left side of the facade is a door that leads to the quarters of the Confraternity of the Blessed Sacrament of Avvocata, where there are frescoes by Andrea dell'Asta and Francesco Solimena.

Geissorhiza melanthera

Geissorhiza melanthera is a small perennial plant of 14–18 cm (5½–7 in) high that is assigned to the Iridaceae. It survives the dry southern summer through storage of its resources in a corm. The stem carries two or three erect, sticky leaves of up to 18 cm (7 in) long, H-shaped in cross-section. This species blooms with six to twelve bilaterally symmetrical flowers, in a spike. Sometimes the spike has one side branch with fewer flowers. Each flower has six pale beige perianth lobes, a purple-red ring around a purple red tube and three blackish stamens. Each flower is subtended by two 1¼–2¼ cm (½–⅞ in) long green bracts. This species was found flowering from the end of September till mid October. It is an endemic of the western slopes of the Piketberg mountains in the Western Cape province of South Africa.

The species was described in a publication in 2013 by South African botanists Peter Goldblatt and John Manning. It belongs to the section "Engysiphon".

The bee fly "Megapalpus capensis" is the only species that has been observed visiting the flowers of "Geissorhiza melanthera". Remarkably, "G. melanthera" is the only Iridaceae known to be pollinated by a bee fly. "Megapalpus capensis" is also known to visit several "Pelargonium" species, all of which have white, cream or pale pink petals with blackish markings and mostly dark anthers. "Gorteria diffusa" that is visited by the same bee fly species often has dark spots on some or all of its yellow or orange ray florets, that closely mimic the bee fly's appearance. The species grows in deep sandy soils, on gentle slopes facing south, in an ecosystem called Leipoldtville Sand Fynbos.

"G. melanthera" is known from only two locations, for one of which has been has been requested to allow to reclaim it for the cultivation of rooibos. It is therefore considered endangered.

CREATES Act

The CREATES Act of 2017 is a bipartisan United States bill proposed by sponsor Senator Patrick Leahy. The bill includes measures to reduce price and increase competitiveness of generic pharmaceutical drugs.

The bill has been drafted in some form since the year 2016. Measures in the bill are intended to prevent pharmaceutical companies from blocking companies from producing generic drugs by refusing to sell drugs to the new companies, or taking advantage of safety regulation to block new drugs. Generic drug companies would be allowed to sue to gain access to samples. The resulting impact of the bill would be a reduction in generic drug prices via increased market competition.

The Congressional Budget Office has provided estimates that the bill would save $3.8 billion over a 10-year period.

The bill was intended for inclusion in the February 2018 budget package. However, as a result of lobbying from pharmaceutical companies and other opposition, the provision was removed from the final budget provision.

The bill has support from conservatives including Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. Liberal Democrat senators have also voiced support of the bill including Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. The bill also include support from prominent think tanks including conservative groups Heritage Action and FreedomWorks, as well as liberal think tanks Families USA and Public Citizen.

Public surveys as a result of the bill have polled if Congress and Trump “need to do more” on drug prices, with 75% surveyed saying that they "need to do more", while around 10% of those surveyed said that they think that they have done enough.

Opponents of the CREATES Act have suggested that the bill does not advocate a good solution to the issue of Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy with Elements to Assure Safe Use, or "REMS with ETASU" processes. These programs can include physician training, patient registries or follow-up testing.

The bill is opposed by Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).

Azwanddin Hamzah

"This is a Malay name; the name Hamzah is a patronymic, not a family name, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Azwanddin."

Dato' Hajji Azwanddin Hamzah is a businessman, philanthropist and political activist, known to be a critic on the issues of corruption in Malaysia.

Azwanddin was born on 26 September, 1973 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He is married and blessed with four children. 

Azwanddin received his early education at Sekolah Rendah Jenis Kebangsaan Cina Lee Rubber, Gombak. He then continued his secondary school education at Chong Hwa Secondary School, Kuala Lumpur where he achieved his Sijil Rendah Pelajaran, and Sekolah Menengah Chong Hwa Sin, Kuala Terengganu. Azwanddin Hamzah obtained his Bachelor (1995) and Master of Business Administration (1996) from Western University, Canada.

Not surprisingly, Azwanddin is fluent in Malay, Mandarin, and English languages. He credits this to the multicultural setting of Malaysia and the years of education in Chinese-medium schools. 

In his spare time, Azwanddin is passionate about football and horse riding. He is currently the President of Jaringan Melayu Malaysia Football Club which was the champion of the 2016/2017 Kuala Lumpur Football Association Super League.

Azwanddin is currently the Chairman of T&D Construction Sdn Bhd since 2010, which forms as one of the three companies of the T&D Group of Companies. Construction became the core business of T&D Group of Companies since its establishment in 2002, now with structured diversification in specialist sectors related to construction. 

Other notable memberships of Azwanddin include the membership of the Malaysia – Indonesia Business Council to enhance private sector bilateral trade relation between Malaysia and Indonesia through the promotion of mutually beneficial business and investment opportunities. Of note, Azwanddin is also a member of the Relationship, Lanzhou Lanmarch eCommerce Technology Ltd. of China where he channels his interest in promoting halal products in Lanzhou and China. Azwanddin is also the honorary advisor of Koperasi Jaringan Melayu Selangor Berhad, which was established to support the efforts and struggles in developing and assisting the advancement of the Malay socioeconomic standing. 

Previously, from 2015 to 2017, Azwanddin held a position in the Board of Directors of Amanah Nusantara National, a corporate consultant organisation to develop Cirebon into an integrated developed city to accommodate and support the national development and economic plans of Indonesia.

As a board member of the "Yayasan Generasi Amanah" Indonesia, Azwanddin seeks to uphold cooperation between ASEAN countries such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines in welfare activities through regional economic activity embodied. Azwanddin is also interested in the arts, particularly in upholding Malay performing arts through his involvement as the vice chairman of Yayasan Nusantara.

Through many capacities, Azwanddin is a firm believer of honesty and integrity in work and continually expresses his stance against corruption issues in Malaysia.

Currently, Azwanddin feels that his efforts to fight corruption are best channeled through his capacity as Chairman of MyAduan Rasuah JMM (officiated by Tan Sri Dzulkifli Ahmad).

Azwanddin is the founder of in 2008. JMM is a non-governmental organisation that aims to promote racial harmony and unity through upholding the constitutional rights of Malays as well as the rights of other races in Malaysia. In particular, JMM strives to fight any foreign elements that have the potential to disrupt the racial harmony and unity in Malaysia. JMM also aims to uphold the integrity and leadership of professionals in managing the country’s assets. 

Prior to 2011, JMM had struggled to find relevance in the current Malaysian political and socio-economic climate and it was through the extraordinary efforts of Azwanddin that key issues promoted by JMM such as the anti-corruption stance, received prominence in the Malaysian sphere. 

JMM began to receive significant public and media attention due to its anti-LGBTQ stance since 2011. As a devout Muslim and the president of JMM, Azwanddin voiced his concerns on the influence of LGBTQ in youth, the rise of HIV diagnosis among these communities and the resulting breakdown of marriages due to one partner being a closeted gay or lesbian. Of course, these views do not resonate with the current Malaysian and global liberal views on sexuality and JMM’s stance on LGBTQ remains a controversy to these parties.

Cerebral palsy is close to Azwanddin's heart as one of his sons suffers from this condition. As a member of the Family Support Group of Cerebral Palsy at Kuala Lumpur Hospital, Azwanddin provides his whole-support towards the cause.

Azwanddin believes that youth is important for the Malaysia's development and in 2017, he became the patron of Rojak United - a voluntary youth engagement and data-driven entity focusing on apolitical civic issues concerning youth.

Azwanddin was awarded with "Darjah Indera Mahkota" which carried a "Datoship" title from the Sultan of Pahang in October 2016 . In 2018, he was conferred the Malaysian Civil Defence Force (APM) Honorary Colonel Award

Action of 2 January 1783

The Action of 2 January 1783 was a minor naval battle that took place in the Caribbean during the last stages of the American War of Independence. Severe fighting between a Royal Navy frigate HMS "Magicienne" and a French frigate "Sibylle" went on for nearly two hours but in that time both frigates were reduced to a wreck.

Captain Thomas Graves was in command of HMS "Magicienne" and was part of the British blockade off Cap-François, Saint-Domingue by the Royal Naval Jamaica station.

Off Cap-François into the open sea, a French convoy was sighted by HMS "Endymion". At 0630 the "Endymion" made a signal that the convoy was French. The French convoy had sailed from Cap François on 27 December 1782 carrying goods and money to the Chesapeake. A ship of the convoy had strayed and steered toward the British ship. At 0900 the "Endymion" came up with her and captured which turned out to be the "Celerity", a rich prize, valued at 20,000 Francs. Meanwhile, the "Magicienne" came up to assist in shifting the prisoners and goods. At 0930 "Endymion" signalled "Magicienne" to chase to the northeast. Kergariou decided to steer toward the British in order to draw them away from the convoy and signalled the convoy to continue on its course.

Graves then set about clearing his ship for action. Shortly after the three leewardmost of the French vessels bore away and followed the French convoy. The French warships raised their colours and prepared to give battle.

At 1230 the "Magicienne" closed up with the smaller ship; the French sloop "Railleur" of 14 guns, and a short action took place. After having fired two broadsides into the sloop the French frigate "Sibylle" dropped back to assist the struggling "Railleur", and "Magicienne" moved away. "Sibylle" was rated at 600 tons and mounted twenty-six 12-pounders and six 6-pounders. She had been coppered and was a fast sailing frigate. She had a crew of 271 men under the Comte de Kergariou-Locmaria. "Magicienne" sailed on and soon got on the port quarter of the "Sybille". The guns were practically muzzle to muzzle as men hurled shot by the hand and frequently at each other through the port holes with half pikes and gun rammers to distract each other from firing.
At 1415 the "Magicienne" had nearly silenced the "Sybille’"s fire and the British began to hope and expect that the French would soon surrender. Then, a French shot brought down "Magicienne"’s mizzen and fore-topmast. The wreck fell clear of the "Sybille" and she fell astern. Just after "Magicienne"’s masts fell, a broadside from the British ship cleared "Sybille"’s forecastle and killed eleven men. Kargariou was struck down on the quarterdeck and his men thought he was dead for some time but was only wounded. Lieutenant de vaisseau Morel-d’Escures, the second in command continued the action.

About 1420 the "Magicienne’"s fore and main masts went overboard. "Sybille" now made off as "Endymion" and "Emerald" were seen to approach. "Magicienne" was unable to do any thing except fire every available gun into her stern. The action had lasted for an hour and forty-five minutes.

The "Magicienne" was towed by "Endymion" and "Emerald" and went to Jamaica a fortnight later. The only prize, the "Celerity", never made port and was lost on a rock on 9 January off the island of Heneaga. The "Sybille" however being so damaged was captured on 22 January 1783 by HMS "Hussar" under Thomas McNamara Russell. Thomas Graves later addressed two engravings of the battle, one represented its beginning, and the other its end.

Francis Erskine Loch

Admiral Francis Erskine Loch (1788–1868) was a senior commander in the Royal Navy during the early 19th century. He served as naval aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria.

He was born in April 1788 in Drylaw House north of Edinburgh (now within the city boundary) the son of George Loch (1749-1788) and his wife Mary Adam, daughter of John Adam of the world-renowned Adam family of architects.

He entered the Royal Navy on 1 September 1799 aged eleven as a cabin boy under Cpt Andrew Todd on the then nine year old HMS Queen Charlotte in the fleet of Lord Keith. On 17 March 1800 Loch narrowly escaped death when the ship was destroyed by fire and blew up killing 673 men off the Italian coast near Leghorn. Loch was one of the very few survivors.

Placed on the HMS Minotaur he was present at the blockade of Genoa in May 1800. Serving as a young midshipman still under Lord Keith he joined the HMS Mondovi under Cpt John Stewart. He was placed on the island of Rhodes overseeing the equipping of gunboats bound for Egypt and Lake Mareotis early in 1801. He then joined HMS Pearl until November 1801.

From May 1803 to 1805 he served under his cousin, Cpt Adam on the captured French frigate La Chiffone on which he saw major action on 10 June 1805 during the height of the naval actions of the Napoleonic War.

In January 1806 he was promoted to Lieutenant on HMS Diadem under Rear Admiral Charles Stirling. His most important action in this period was on HMS Queen Charlotte (the replacement ship to the earlier one of that name), at the blockade of Rio de la Plata. He stayed with the Charlotte until his promotion to captain.

His first command was on HMS Rover in 1812. He moved to HMS Minstrel in 1815, and HMS Eden in 1821. In the latter he served in the East Indies and Persian Gulf, acting as the senior officer for this zone. His last active service was from June to September 1839 on HMS Hastings in the Mediterranean.

He was invalided out of active service in the summer of 1939. From September 1839 to September 1841 he was commander of HMS Victory, not the fanous ship, but a guard-ship placed at Portsmouth. In 1847 he was made Naval aide-de-camp to Queen Victoria (a prestigious but non-active role). Loch then underwent several promotions,
but without command: Rear Admiral (1850); Vice Admiral (1857); Admiral (1860).

He retired to Edinburgh in 1860, living at 22 George Square as neighbour to Rev Patrick Clason.

He died in Cheltenham on 13 February 1868.

Loch's family connections are impressive: great grandfather- William Adam; great uncle - Robert Adam; uncle - William Adam of Blair Adam; cousin - Admiral Sir Charles Adam; nephews - Cpt Granville Gower Loch RN and Lt George Jogn Loch RN.

In 1822 he was married to Jesse Robertson in Edinburgh. Jesse was the daughter of Major Robertson, Barrack-Master-General of North Britain. Their known children were:


Francis' children included Major General Granville George Loch (1870-1950)

His diary and sketch-books are held at the National Archive in Kew.

Nuclear shaped charge

Nuclear shaped charges refers to nuclear weapons that focus the energy of their explosion into certain directions, as opposed to a spherical explosion. Edward Teller referred to such concepts as third-generation weapons, the first generation being the atom bomb and the second the H-bomb.

The basic concept has been raised on several occasions, with the first known references being part of the Project Orion nuclear-powered spacecraft project in the 1960s. This used beryllium oxide to convert the X-rays released by a small bomb into infrared light, which explosively vaporized a tamper material, normally tungsten, causing it to carry away much of the bomb's energy as kinetic energy in the form of tungsten plasma. The same concept was explored as a weapon in the Casaba Howitzer proposals.

The ideas were explored by Los Alamos National Laboratory as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative.

<doc id="56570941" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56570941" title="St. Mary of the Angels Church, Hollywood">
St. Mary of the Angels Church, Hollywood

St. Mary of the Angels Church, Hollywood, formally the St. Mary of the Angels Anglo-Catholic Church, Hollywood, California, and referred to locally as "St. Mary's", is an Anglo-Catholic church in Hollywood, California. The current Rector is Fr. Christopher Kelley.

St. Mary's was founded by , an Iowan native who moved to Hollywood, California and became a technical advisor and eventual actor in the early years of Hollywood’s film industry development. His involvement in the early days of Hollywood as priest on and off screen earned him many nicknames, like “The Padre of Hollywood”, “Hollywood’s Padre”, and “One Take Dodd”.
Originally, St. Mary's and her congregation gathered in a small storefront on N. Vermont Avenue in Hollywood, before moving to a space on New Hampshire Avenue where a Lutheran church now stands. The old church building on New Hampshire was razed in preparations for the Lutheran church's construction.

The first church building for St. Mary's was a rented storefront on N Vermont Avenue that still stands today. However, St. Mary's moved not too long after. After having raised $1100USD (February 4, 2018 equivalent: $17,832.09), a small church building was built in a week on New Hampshire Avenue.

The present building was designed in the Spanish Mission-style by noted architect Carleton Winslow. Much of the planning occurred in 1929. Church records of tentative specifications for St. Mary's include specific details for a great deal of wood carpentry, including oak and birch wood with oil staining, varnish, and Lammens "Permo" waterproof brush coats, as well as hand made mission tiles for the roofing. Galvanized iron, steel, copper, concrete, and other materials help complete St. Mary's.

Finials, decorative addictions at the top of the building's façade, were included as well, made of cast stone. At some point, they were no longer a part of the building but were replaced in 2011.

A part of its architecture also includes an addition made in the mid-1900s wherein the altar space was changed slightly to accommodate a 16th-century della Robbia faience from Florence.

The faience is a terra cotta and porcelain altarpiece of the Annunciation, along with two side statues of St. John and St. Francis as well as two smaller side statues of floral arrangements in large vases. It was donated to St. Mary's according to church history in the 1920s by the founder of The Broadway and Bullocks department stores and was a fixture in the church when it was on New Hampshire Avenue.

When the current church building for St. Mary's was built, it was installed outside as a permanent fixture in one of the walls of the small church courtyard garden before being moved inside during the mid-1900s.

According to church records, the remodel of the sanctuary to accommodate the della Robbia required extensive flexibility. The pews inside the church were removed in order to make room for a track to be temporarily installed from the front doors of the church to the altar. A crane was required to carry each piece of the faience to and down the track, sideways. The entirety of the faience weighs over 15 tons.

Furthermore, the church building's floor was reinforced, especially under the altar sanctuary before any of the installation could occur. The area where the faience currently resides was originally a squared-off ending to the building but was replaced with a curved, steel shell was installed behind the altar at the time of installation. Wrought iron work was installed where the della Robbia had been in the garden.


The organ at St Mary's was originally built in 1906 for the S.A. Sanderson residence in Long Beach, California. It was sold in 1912 to E.F. Robbins for his home in Pasadena, California. In 1927, William Ripley Dorr purchased the organ for his studio in Los Angeles, California. Some time after, it was sold to St. Mary's and dedicated. Also according to church history, W.C. Fields underwrote part of the organ.

The organ has tubular pneumatic key action and pneumatic stop action. It also has two (2) manuals, 10 stops, and 10 ranks. Its manual compass is 61 notes and its pedal compass is 30. It also has an attached keydesk.

The Organist and Choirmaster has the responsibility of directing the St Mary of the Angels Schola Cantorum.

Since 1820 the posts of Organist and Choirmaster have been held by a number of musicians, often being combined. The current Organist and Choirmaster, since 2011, is Dr. Kathleen Moon.

The choir at St. Mary's is known as the St. Mary of the Angels Schola Cantorum. They sing at each Sunday Solemn High Mass as well as specific High Holy Days throughout the year, including Christmas, Holy Week, and Easter Masses.

Much of their repertoire comes from the hymnals found in the pews. They also practice anthems or special Mass Parts responses for the weekly services.

Prior selections include:
•"I Was Glad" by C. Hubert H. Parry
•"Laud We The Name Of God Most Holy" by J.S. Bach
•"Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis" by Orlando Gibbons
•"How Lovely is Thy Dwelling Place" by Johannes Brahms
•"Kyrie" and "Agnus Dei I" from Palestrina's "Missa Brevis"

St. Mary's has a rich tradition with regards to their celebration of the Mass. However, this tradition is shared in different ways. A "High Mass" has more music and song in the form of Gregorian Chant or other kinds of chant throughout the Mass. There are also more people involved with the ceremonial aspect of the Mass helping the priest, usually including a deacon and a subdeacon. Incense is also used in during the service. A sermon is almost always shared after the Gospel readings at a High Mass. Usually, the High Mass at St. Mary's is a Solemn High Mass; however, Festal High Masses are celebrated on major feast days.

principal service on Sundays and major holy days.

By contrast, a Low Mass is celebrated by one priest, usually assisted by an acolyte. The words of the liturgy are spoken, not sung, incense is not used, and sermons are rarely included.

The Solemn High Mass for the church is celebrated every Sunday at 10:30AM PST. 
Low Masses include the weekly Wednesday 12:05PM Mass as well as Vespers on Saturdays at 5:00PM.

Throughout the year,

Genoplesium turfosum

Genoplesium turfosum, commonly known as the alpine midge orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid endemic to a small area in the higher parts of New South Wales. It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty five dark purplish-red, crowded flowers with a sparsely hairy labellum.

"Genoplesium turfosum" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf with a purplish base and long, fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between two and twenty five flowers are crowded along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height . The flowers lean downwards, are dark purplish-red and about wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is linear to egg-shaped, about long, wide and reddish-purple with darker bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are linear to egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark bands. The labellum is linear to egg-shaped, long, about wide with a few coarse, blackish hairs up to long on its edges. There is a dark purplish-black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in November and December.

"Genoplesium turfosum" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "Corunastylis turfosa". The specific epithet ("turfosum") is a Latin word meaning "peaty" or "boggy", referring to the habitat of this orchid.

The alpine midge orchid grows with dense sedges in boggy places in the Kosciuszko National Park.

Mydas clavatus

Mydas clavatus is a species of Mydas fly that is native to temperate, eastern North America. It is named for its clubbed antennae, which is however a general feature of the Mydas flies. An orange to red mark on the abdomen is distinctive. It is a Batesian mimic of certain spider wasps, and is consequently quite bold in its movements. Adults fly in mid-summer.

They are large, black and somewhat glabrate flies that measure some 25 to 30 mm in length, with a wingspan that may exceed 50 mm. A prominent orange to red mark is evident on the ventral side of the second abdominal segment. Their visual mimicry is apparently complemented by curling and jabbing of the abdomen in a mock stinging routine.

The eggs are deposited singly in soil or rotting wood. The larvae, as with "M. brunneus" and "M. tibialis", are predatory on the larvae of deadwood-feeding scarab beetles ("Osmoderma" species.) and can be found in standing and downed trees with extensive heart rot. The adults seem to be pollen and nectar feeders only, and have been observed at "Asclepias", "Saponana", "Spiraea", "Monarda", "Pycnanthemum", "Teucrium" and "Verbena" flowers. When not nectaring, adults may be seen resting on plants or actively running around on the ground. Though the mating behaviour is unknown, it is suspected that males may defend the vicinity of larval food sources.

They are present in various habitats, including deciduous woodlands, fields, meadows, gardens, and other.

Agbenyefia was born in 1978 and 1989 she started at Mawuko Girls Secondary School. Two years later she was at Mawuli Secondary School. She took a BSc in Business Administration at the University of Ghana graduating in 2009. Agbenyefia also holds a Postgraduate Certificate in Public Administration from the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration.

Agbenyefia had gained the unusual ambition of becoming a pilot. She applied to join the air force but when she turned up with the other recruits she found that she had been assigned to the army. She challenged this with Joseph Narh Adinkra and she was told that the air force did not take women. She challenged this and her tenacity was rewarded when she was sent away with other prospective pilots for training.

The prospective candidates were reduced to 20 and then to 15 when they were based at the Ghana Military Academy at Teshie in Accra. Her first flight was in a Aero L-29 Delfín Jet Trainer which she first flew with Air Commodore Philip Ayisa in September 1998. There had been women pilots before in Ghana but the two who did fly retired after the 1966 coup in Ghana, so she was the first for 35 years, it is said that she is the first woman pilot of military helicopters in West Africa for 48 years.. 

In 2015 she was credited with saving President John Mahama's life when she made an unscheduled landing.

The modern flag is an expression of respect for the history and tradition of the Duchy of Teschen, and also part of the different identities of the present inhabitants of the Cieszyn Silesia towards Lower and Upper Silesia. 

The oldest image of the Duchy of Teschen flag or banner was shown on the personal seal of the first duke, Mieszko I. That seal was attached to the document from 1297. The next premises of the flags, or rather ducal banners, date from the 14th century, and are associated with Duke Przemyslaw I Noszak (read: Noschack) who, from 1355, took an active part in political life, becoming one of the most important figures in the court of the Czech rulers over time, which included Emperor Charles IV and King Wenceslas IV. Unfortunately, banners from this period have not survived to our times. .
The banner of the Duchy of Teschen, since 1605, remains the oldest preserved image of the ducal flag. The banner was ordered by Duke Adam Wenceslas, who, in 1605, was appointed commander of the Silesian army. As a lynnik of the Habsburgs, he was involved in wars in Hungary and Moravia. The banner was made of blue satin and 160 x 240 cm in size. In the front part, there is a gold-painted eagle of the Duchy of Teschen, and the free part ends with two sharp tongues.

The ducal banners, which bore the image of golden eagles in a crown on a blue background, were used until the death of the last Piast ruler, Elisabeth Lucretia. From 1742, the official flag of the Duchy of Teschen was the Austrian Silesia flag, which included the Duchy of Teschen. 

The flag’s colouring refers directly to the preserved iconographic messages of the dynastic coat of arms of the Teschen Piasts and the 17th century banner of the Duchy of Teschen. From the end of the 13th century, the shield of the dukes of Teschen was a golden eagle facing left in a blue field. From the 15th century, it was a golden crowned eagle, although the image of the crowned eagle appeared in the 14th century on the castle tiles during the Duke Premysl I Noszak era. Some foreign sources, such as the Stockholm Codex Bergshammar, from 1430-1436, show the Teschen eagle with a red beak, tongue, and claws. However, later sources, such as the "Silesian Arms," from 1577-1578, depict an eagle with only a red tongue, emerging from the half-open beak, which is in the golden colour of the eagle. This unchangeability of the image and colours is confirmed by Siebmacher's coat of arms, and a later description in the work of Spener. The contemporary flag of the Duchy of Teschen also refers to this colour scheme.

In the Duchy of Teschen, from the end of the 15th century, the crowned eagle appeared unceasingly on all ducal seals, coins, and banners, until the death of the Duchess Elizabeth Lucretia in 1653. Thanks to the relations with the court of the last Jagiellon family during the 16th century, the image of the Teschen eagle on the Piast seals was modelled on the eagle from the crown seal of the Kingdom of Poland. The only differences were the form of the crown itself and the colours. On the head of the Polish eagle was the Renaissance-Baroque closed crown, while on the coat of arms of the Duchy of Teschen was the medieval open crown. It is important that the crowned eagle meant priority over the eagle (e.g. Upper Silesia, Lower Silesia), which could not be crowned. In European heraldry, the crowned eagle is a state eagle and means sovereignty. The eagle on the contemporary flag of the Duchy of Teschen (also Duchy of Cieszyn) is a direct representation of the 16th century version

The Monolith Tour

The Monolith Tour is an upcoming worldwide concert tour by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. Staged in support of the band's fifth studio album America, the tour will visit arenas and stadiums throughout 2018. It was initially announced in October 2017 with European dates being released at the same time, with North American dates announced afterwards. It is set to begin on March 12, 2018 in Basel, Switzerland, and is set to conclude on September 8 in Milan, Italy. The set support acts for the tour include Walk the Moon, K.Flay, MisterWives, Joywave, and Welshly Arms.

The tour is promoted by Live Nation and sponsored in-part by AT&T. Due to the large demand and tickets selling out in minutes in multiple locations, extra tour dates were added to the itinerary.

Thirty Seconds to Mars officially announced the tour on October 6, 2017, shortly after releasing the song "Walk on Water" as the lead single from their fifth studio album. The band debuted live the song at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, during a performance which was described as groundbreaking since it became the first live broadcasting shown through innovative infrared technology. The announcement came after the band concluded a promotional tour with Muse and PVRIS, which was one of the highest-grossing North American tour of 2017, according to "Pollstar"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s annual year end tour chart. On February 8, 2018, tour dates were revealed for North America in two legs. Frontman Jared Leto made the announcement on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", giving members of the audience a ticket to an upcoming show. In addition, it was announced that the band's fifth studio album will be released on April 6, 2018. Walk the Moon, K.Flay, MisterWives, Joywave, and Welshly Arms were confirmed as the supporting acts on select dates.

Initially, twenty-nine shows were scheduled in Europe beginning in March 2018. Pre-sale tickets for the tour were offered to the band's fan club members on October 11, 2017, before going on sale to the general public on October 13. Initial dates for the tour sold out, prompting Live Nation to extend the tour with additional dates. In February 2018, thirty shows were announced to take place across the United States and Canada, beginning in June 2018. For the North American dates, Thirty Seconds to Mars partnered with Citigroup and AT&T; the latter partly sponsored the tour, including the Camp Mars Music Festival held in Malibu, California by the band. Tickets for North American dates went on sale to the general public on February 16 at Live Nation. Copies of the album are included along with the purchased tickets. Special privileges were provided to Citi bank card holders, who had the opportunity to utilize the pre-sale in multiple locations on February 13.

On March 16, 2018, it was announced that the lead guitarist of the band, Tomo Miličević, would be taking a break from the tour due to personal matters.

The Casa dello Scugnizzo (House of the Scugnizzo), is a multifunctional foundation of social assistance in the district of Materdei in Naples. 

It was founded in 1951 by Father Mario Borrelli in one of the poorest districts of Naples to care for the street children of Naples. During the war, Naples was a major base for American and other allied Navies. At then end of the ware, Italy, and Naples in particular, was desperately poor. When the navies sailed to their home waters after the war, many children were left in Naples with no care or social support. Mario Borrelli recognised this issue and set up the Casa dello Scugnizzo to provide a refuge for these children where they could be fed and educated, helping them to achieve fulfilling lives. Borrelli also helped to set up a network of committees throughout Europe and America to provide funding and support.

In 1958, the film "The Kiss of the Sun"(also known as " Il bacio del Sole-Don Vesuvio"), was released in cinemas and was distributed throughout Europe, while British television (ITV Television Playhouse) produced a biographical script in episodes entitled "Children of the Sun".

In addition to child care, the foundation now helps women, the elderly and immigrants thanks to collaboration with other bodies.

Makarony po-flotski

Makarony po-flotski (Russian: "макароны по-флотски", literally navy-style pasta) is a Russian dish made of cooked pasta (typically macaroni, penne or fusilli) mixed with stuffing made of stewed ground meat (usually beef or pork), fried onions and seasoned with salt and black pepper. Originally served in maritime forces, the dish became very popular in Russia because of simplicity, low costs and quickness of its preparation. Makarony po-flotski became highly popular after the World War II during times of poverty in Soviet Union.

The pasta is cooked in salted boiling water. The onions are well chopped, while meat is minced. After pouring some oil on the pan the chopped onions are fried and after they get a golden color the meat is added to them to get fried. The ground meat can be replaced by canned meat ("tushonka"). The stuffing is seasoned with salt and pepper. When the meat is fried and the pasta is cooked they are mixed together. The dish is usually served without any additions, but can be eaten with pickles.

Sir William Bilsland

Sir William Bilsland LLD (17 March 1847–1921) was a Scottish baker who owned one of Scotland's largest bakeries, and was Lord Provost of Glasgow. He was an elder of the United Free Church of Scotland and a supporter of the temperance movement.

He was born on 17 March 1847 at Ballat near Balfron, the son of Ann Blair and James Bilsland, a farmer.

He was educated at Dalmanoch school in Bonhill living there with his uncle, Dr Alexander Leckie.

From 1860 to 1869 he worked as a grocer's assistant in Glasgow. In 1869 he opened a shop at 223 Garscube Road. In 1872 he opened a bakery in Greenhill Street and also acquired an existing bakery in Elderslie Street.

In 1877, with his brothers, he bought a large piece of ground on Hydepark Street and on which they built the large Hydepark Bakery, adopting the company name of Bilsland Brothers.

By 1900 they employed 200 people and made 230,000 loaves of bread a week, over 10 million loaves per year. They supplied 1600 retailers. Workers were well-paid, worked a 40 hour maximum week, unusual for the time, and all received free bread.

In 1912 they acquired the rival company of Gray and Dunn (but retained their name as Gray Dunn & Co). The main company was rebranded as Glasgow Bakeries.

The company traded until 1985. The bakery was demolished in 2015.

In 1886 he became a town councillor representing the 13th ward in Glasgow.

In 1905 he was elected Lord Provost, succeeding John Ure Primrose. He served until 1908 during which time he saw many artistic projects, in particular the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. During this period he lived at 28 Park Circus a beautiful, three-storey Georgian circus form, just east of Kelvingrove Park.

In 1907 King Edward VII created him a baronet, as Sir William Bilsland, Baronet of Park Circus, for his services to Glasgow.

He died on 27 August 1921.

In 1885 he married Agnes Anne Steven (d.1935). Together they had two childrenAgnes Anne (1896-1970) and Steven Bilsland, who inherited the business on his death.

Neil Gaiman: Dream Dangerously is a feature-length documentary that takes an in depth look at the life, career and mind of the English fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. "Dream Dangerously" follows Gaiman on his 2013 signing tour, and also delves into his creative process and personal background. It includes interviews with friends artists, editors and other industry professionals.

"Dream Dangerously" is co-produced by Sequart and Respect Films. The film grew out of preview collaborations "Grant Morrison: Talking With Gods" and "Warren Ellis: Captured Ghosts". The team felt that Gaiman would be a perfect subject for a next project. At the time, Gaiman was preparing for his final signing tour, which became one of the central subjects of the documentary.

Meaney and Rennert followed Gaiman on his tour in the US and through all of England. This footage became the spine of the film. 

This material was supplemented with interviews with Gaiman's collaborators, like DC editor Karen Berger, author Terry Pratchett, as well as his friends and fans like Bill Hader, Michael Sheen and Lenny Henry. 

The film follows Neil on his final book signing tour, across the US and UK. While dealing with the challenges of his extensive tour, he reflects on his youth, early creative success and the struggles of balancing creativity and life. 

The film was acquired for distribution by Vimeo, and released in July 2016. It is currently available on Vimeo on Demand and Starz.

Samuel Carter (11 November 1814 – 30 December 1903) was a British Radical politician and lawyer.

Carter was the only son of John Carter and Sarah Green, daughter of John Laimbeer. He began his career in his family tannery business, but in 1844 quit to pursue a legal career, entering Middle Temple as a student in 1844, and being called to the bar in 1847. He practiced on the Western Circuit, where he often acted as defence counsel.

He first stood for election Tavistock, seeking election on both a Radical and Chartist platform, as well as seeking the extension of the franchise including to women, in 1847 but was not elected until a by-election in April 1852. He campaigned on the grounds of judicial scrutiny, using his legal background. Yet, within nine weeks of his election, parliament was dissolved before he had even taken his seat.

While he was also returned at the general election in July of the same year, this was declared void on 21 February 1853 as he was "not duly qualified". A House of Commons select committee found that, despite Carter owning a home, a tannery, and shares in the local gas company, as well as a bank balance of £47 12s and 8d, he did not meet the property qualification and was unseated. Instead, Robert Phillimore was elected in his place.

Nevertheless, during this brief period of his career, Carter did cause furore in the Commons, after this time being able to take his seat. On 16 November 1852, he complained of the £80,000 cost for the funeral of the Duke of Wellington, five times more than to bury Lord Nelson.

Five years after his unseating, Parliament removed the property qualification for MPs.

Carter, having been unseated, resumed his legal career, becoming a revising barrister - involving checking electoral rolls - before losing that job in 1894 after causing offence to too many people.

He married to Caroline Bennison, daughter of John W Bennison, in 1858, and together they had one child: Reginald Llewellyn Bennison.

National Little Britches Rodeo Association

The National Little Britches Rodeo (NLBRA) is one of the oldest youth based rodeo organizations. It was founded in 1952, and sanctions rodeos in over 33 states. NLBRA allows children ages 5 to 18 to compete in a variety of different rodeo events. It’s championship event is the National Little Britches Finals Rodeo. The NLBRA headquarters is based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. The NLBRA was founded in Littleton, Colorado. The Finals were held in Pueblo, Colorado, but moved to the Lazy E in Oklahoma in 2016.

The PRCA partners with the NLBRA to offer rodeo camps and safety clinics for contestants. The ProRodeo Hall of Fame and Museum of the American Cowboy opened up a National Little Britches Rodeo Association exhibit September 20, 2015. In December 2013, Hope Counts was adopted as the Crisis Fund of the NLBRA.

The NLBRA is featured on a national television western lifestyle show that airs on RFD-TV titled Little Britches Rodeo. They also have a spin-off travel show titled Little Britches on the Road.

The NLBRA provides three different age groups. Little Wrangler is a coed age group of children between the ages of 5 and 8. Kids ages 9–13 are junior contestants. Senior contestants are ages 14 through 18. Both the junior and senior divisions are broken down into boys and girls events. There are also coed events for the junior and senior categories.


In addition there are awards based up senior and junior all-around cowgirl and all-around cowboy.

A number of notable Pro Rodeo cowboys got their start in Little Britches rodeo.

NLBRA also features a rodeo queen contest every year at their National Finals. They have three categories: National Queen, National Princess, and National Little Wrangler Princess. The categories are by age group. The National Queen is for contestants 14–18 years old. The National Princess is for contestants 9–13 years old. The National Little Wrangler Princess is for girls ages 5–8.

To be eligible, contestants must accumulate enough points, in rodeo competition, to qualify for the National Finals. The rodeo queen contest involves horsemanship, speaking, and a written test. Several contestants have gone on to win state title for Miss Rodeo America.

The United States has thirty three state NLBRA organizations. Alabama - Arizona - Arkansas - Colorado - Georgia - Idaho - Illinois - Indiana - Iowa - Kansas - Kentucky - Louisiana - Michigan - Minnesota - Mississippi - Missouri - Montana - Nebraska - Nevada - New Mexico- North Carolina - North Dakota - Ohio - Oklahoma - Oregon - South Carolina - South Dakota - Tennessee - Texas - Utah - Virginia - Wisconsin - Wyoming

Ludger Wößmann

Ludger Wößmann (born in Sendenhorst on July 1st, 1973) is a German economist and professor of economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich (LMU). Moreover, being one of the world's foremost education economists, he is the director of the ifo Center for the Economics of Education at the ifo Institute. Beyond the economics of education, his research interests also include economic growth and economic history. In 2014, Wößmann's empirical research on the effects of education and his corresponding contribution to public debate were awarded the Gossen Prize (the German equivalent of the John Bates Clark Medal), followed by the Gustav Stolper Prize in 2017.

A native of Sendenhorst (North Rhine-Westphalia), Ludger Wößmann earned a M.A. from the University of Marburg in 1998, a Ph.D. (Dr. sc. pol.) from Kiel University in 2001 under Horst Siebert, and obtained his habilitation from the Technical University of Munich in 2006 under Robert K. von Weizsäcker and Hans-Werner Sinn, with all degrees being in economics. Additionally, he also studied at the University of Kent at Canterbury (1995-96) and at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) (1998-99), where he worked as a researcher before and after his Ph.D. (1999-2003). In 2003, Wößmann became Senior Researcher at the ifo Institute, where he took over the leadership of the ifo Center for the Economics of Education one year later. Following his habilitation in 2006, he has worked as a professor of economics at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In parallel to his academic career in Germany, Wößmann has also held visiting appointments at the Hoover Institution (2007, 2014-15), at Harvard University (2007) and at Aarhus Business School (2006).

In terms of professional service, Wößmann maintains affiliations with various economic research institutes, including the IZA Institute of Labor Economics, CESifo, Warwick University's Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (CAGE), and Harvard University's Program on Education Policy and Governance (PEPG). Moreover, he is a fellow of the International Academy of Education, sits on the editorial boards of the "Economics of Education Review" and "Education Economics", is a member of the Executive Committee of the German Economic Association and chairs its Research Committee on the Economics of Education. Finally, he is also a member of the Academic Advisory Council of the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) as well as of the German Academy of Science and Engineering and the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

Ludger Wößmann's main research interests are the determinants of educational achievement and the determinants of long-term prosperity. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Wößmann belongs to the 1% of most cited economists, with a leading position in rankings of education economists. Together with Eric A. Hanushek and Stephen Machin, Wößmann has been a co-editor of the "Handbook of the Economics of Education", the main academic reference in the field of economics of education, since 2011.

One major strand of Wößmann's research studies the determinants of student achievement, including the role of class size and teacher quality, of educational institutions and education systems, and of tracking and early childhood education. Key themes within this research are the often small effect of quantitative educational inputs such as class size, on students' cognitive skills in developed countries and the substantial effects of educational institutions and systems as well as of the quality of teaching. In this context, Wößmann's analyses of students' performance using TIMSS and PISA data find central exams and control mechanisms, school autonomy in personnel and process decisions, individual teachers' influence over teaching methods, limits to teacher unions' influence on curriculum scope, scrutiny of students' achievements and competition from private schools to be related with higher student performance, findings for which Wößmann and John Bishop provide theoretical foundations. As a consequence, Wößmann has argued in favour of policies promoting school accountability, school autonomy, and school choice, the latter including school choice through public funding for private schools as means to improve learning outcomes. However, while Wößmann emphasizes that school autonomy has positively affected student achievement in developed countries or countries with high-performing education systems, he also cautions that school autonomy may have the oppositive effect in countries with low-performing education systems, including many developing countries, i.e. educational reforms need to be applied with nuance. 

Moving beyond the efficiency of education, Wößmann (with Gabriela Schütz and Heinrich Ursprung) has also investigated the inequality of educational opportunity in developed and emerging countries and finds the organisational setup of the education system to have a substantial effect. In particular, he finds private financing of education (but not publicly funded private schools), early tracking and very short as well as very long pre-school education to exacerbate educational inequality. Relatedly, Wößmann finds family background to strongly and similarly affect student performance in both European countries and the United States, with the influence of family background being strongest in Germany and Britain and lowest in France and Flemish Belgium. In sum, however, Wößmann argues that education and training systems can advance efficiency and equity at the same time by exploiting complementarities between high returns to (public) educational investment concentrating during early childhood for poor families and high returns during later stages for wealthier families through a policy mix which effectively includes public early childhood education and lifelong training in addition to conventional vocational and higher education.

The other major strand of Wößmann's research addresses the determinants of long-run economic development and short-run economic growth, including education, religion, culture, innovation, and economic structure. Addressing Lant Pritchett's puzzle of a missing link between growth rates in schooling and in economic output, Wößmann and Eric Hanushek find cognitive skills - instead of mere schooling - to be strongly related to individual earnings, income (in-)equality and economic growth, with important roles for both minimal and high level skills as well as for complementarities between skills and economic institutions. Consequently, they conclude that measures of school enrollment and attainment tend to underestimate the very large gap between the skill levels of developing and developed countries' populations and that global economic convergence requires a closing of that gap, including through the restructuring of developing countries' educational institutions. Relatedly, Wößmann and Hanushek find that using educational attainment instead of school attainment as a measure of human capital enables low growth in Latin American countries' human capital in the second half of the 20th century to largely solve the "Latin American growth puzzle" by explaining up to two thirds of income differences between that region and the rest of the world. The initial conclusion of Wößmann and Hanushek's research of a strong positive relationship between countries' growth in cognitive skills and economic output has been robust to more sophisticated measures of cross-country educational achievement.

More recently, Wößmann's research has also investigated the international returns to skills as well as the labour market outcomes of different types of education. Criticizing again the use of school attainment as a measure of human capital as well as previous studies' focus on early career earnings, Wößmann and Hanushek (with Guido Schwerdt and Simon Wiederhold) find the lifetime returns to skills based on PIAAC data on adult skills to be about a quarter higher than earlier estimates. Differences between countries' returns to skills estimates are considerable: 14 out of 23 countries display returns to skills in excess of 12% per standard deviation increase, with six countries sporting returns to skills in excess of 21%, the largest returns being offered in the United States at 28%; generally, higher union density, stricter employment protection and larger public sectors are associated with lower returns to skills. Comparing the employment outcomes of general and vocational education, Wößmann, Hanushek and Lei Zhang identify a trade-off between the gains in youth employment afforded by vocational education and the increased adaptability and higher prime-age employment associated with general education, especially in the context of technological change.

In another part of his research on economic growth, Wößmann has studied the roles of innovation, trade, structural change, and the internet. Analysing the impact of structural change in a dual economy on growth, Wößmann and Jonathan Temple argue that changes in the structure of employment will increase productivity more the higher the inequality between both sectors' marginal products of labour, suggesting that differences in labour reallocation may account for a substantial part of cross-country differences in economic growth. Drawing on theories of the relationship between trade and growth, Wößmann (with Stefan Lachenmaier) investigates whether innovation in Germany causes exports and suggests that innovation aimed at addressing specific challenges faced by manufacturing on average increases the export share of these firms by about seven percentage points. Last, in their estimation of the effect of broadband infrastructure, a prerequisite for high-speed internet, Wößmann, Nina Czernich, Oliver Falck and Tobias Kretschmer find that a 10% percentage increase in broadband penetration among OECD countries is associated with an increase in annual per capita growth of 0.9-1.5pp. 

Regarding long-term economic development, Wößmann has been investigating the roles of education, religion and culture in work with fellow economist Sascha Becker. Challenging Max Weber's theory of Protestants' work ethic as the main cause for their higher prosperity, they instead argue that Protestant economies prospered because Protestant society emphasized laypeople's Bible lecture, which in turn increased human capital and, by extension, economic prosperity, and find Prussian Protestants' higher literacy in the 19th century to account for most of the difference in economic prosperity to Catholics. In another use of historical Prussian census data, Wößmann, Becker and Francesco Cinnirella present evidence for the existence of a trade-off between child quantity and child education prior to the beginning of Germany's demographic transition, with an endogenous relationship between fertility and education. Finally, in a study of the long-term impact of the Habsburg Empire's civil service on public attitudes, Wößmann, Becker, Katrin Boeckh and Christa Hainz find a positive "Habsburg effect" on current trust and bureaucratic integrity for individuals living in border communities that were narrowly within the Habsburg Empire relative to those that were narrowly without.

Wilcannia Athenaeum

The Wilcannia Athenaeum is a heritage listed, rusticated sandstone building in the town of Wilcannia, New South Wales. Built in 1883 and located at 37 Reid St, the Athenaeum was established to be an institution for community education, a school of arts and included a public library. It has served a number of functions including as a social centre, a library, a newspaper office, a municipal council meeting place, the Wilcannia Telecentre and is now a museum.

A sandstone single-storey building in Victorian Free Classical style with a parapet and central semi-circular entablature with urns, the style of the building reflects the aspirations of the residents of Wilcannia in an era when it was an administrative centre and the third largest inland river port in Australia.

The building is heritage listed.

The original committee for the Athenaeum included Edward Bulwer Lytton ("Plorn") Dickens, the youngest son of Charles Dickens and Frederic Trollope, son of Anthony Trollope, who was responsible for ordering books for the town library. Walterus Brown, the editor of the short lived "Wilcannia Times" newspaper, published from 1874-1888, was a great supporter of the Athenaeum.

In more recent times, the Athenaeum was the location for the Wilcannia Telecentre and currently operates as the Wilcannia Athenaeum Pioneer Museum.

Donald McWhinnie

Educated at Rotherham Grammar School, McWhinnie worked for the BBC in administrative roles in the 1940s and 1950s and was drama Script Editor from 1951 to 1953. In the later 1950s, he became a radio director, and from the 1960s to the 1980s he was a director of television drama.

McWhinnie, Frederick Bradnum, and Desmond Briscoe together established the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In 1959, McWhinnie directed a production of "Embers", a radio play by Samuel Beckett. First broadcast on the BBC Third Programme on 24 June 1959, the play won the RAI prize at the Prix Italia awards later that year.

In 1962, McWhinnie was nominated for a Tony Award for his screen version of Harold Pinter's "The Caretaker".

In 1965, he directed the first Broadway theatre production of the Bill Naughton comedy "All in Good Time", which opened at the Royale Theatre, New York, on 18 February 1965 and closed on 27 March 1965. It starred Donald Wolfit, Marjorie Rhodes, and Richard Dysart.

The inaugural episode of the BBC Television Shakespeare in December 1978 was announced to be "Much Ado About Nothing", directed by McWhinnie and starring Penelope Keith and Michael York. The episode was shot at a cost of £250,000, edited, and announced as the first of the series, but then was suddenly pulled from the schedule and replaced with "Romeo and Juliet". No reasons were given by the BBC, although newspaper reports suggested the episode had been postponed for re-shoots, due to worries that an actor's "very heavy accent" would be a problem for US audiences. However, there were no reshoots, the episode was abandoned and was later replaced by a new adaptation. It appears that the BBC management regarded the production as a failure.

In 1981, McWhinnie was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Director for "Translations".

Mount Morgan State High School

Mount Morgan State High School is a heritage-listed state high school and technical college at 4 Central Street, Mount Morgan, Rockhampton Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1908. It was formerly known as Mount Morgan Technical College. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2015.

Mount Morgan State High School was established in the central Queensland mining town of Mount Morgan in 1912, as one of Queensland's first secondary schools. It commenced operating on the Mount Morgan Technical College site, which the two institutions shared until 1964. The former Technical College Building (1908) and Science Block and Workshop (1913, extended 1918), both masonry buildings, are important in demonstrating the growth of technical colleges in Queensland and the establishment of state high schools. These purpose-designed buildings are excellent examples of technical college and Department of Public Works buildings. The Technical College Building has aesthetic significance for its composition and materials, and as a landmark in the town. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity.

European settlement commenced at Ironstone Mountain (Mount Morgan's initial name) when mining of gold began there in 1882. In 1888 Mount Morgan's population was 4000 people scattered in a series of settlements located close to the Dee River and the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company mine. In time, the town centre developed around Morgan and East Streets. Mount Morgan became a municipality (the Borough of Mount Morgan) in 1890 and in the two decades after its creation most of the town's infrastructure was established. From 1898 the town was linked by the Mount Morgan railway line to Rockhampton over the steep Razor Back Range, reducing the town's isolation. According to the 1901 census the population of the area was 8486, with 6280 living within the Mount Morgan municipality. By 1903 the town had a wide variety of facilities and amenities.

After achieving a record annual gold output in 1889 (the highest in the colony), the Mount Morgan mine was the second largest gold producer in Queensland between 1890 and 1909. During the last five years of the 19th century the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, which operated the mine, trebled its annual output of ore, employing an army of new men who increased the town's population to 10,000. The highest production of gold was achieved during the period from 1887 to 1897, after which production fell. From 1906-7 the production focus of the mine changed from gold to copper, but falling copper prices impacted adversely on this.

Technical education classes started in Mount Morgan in 1900 to meet the growing need for skilled labour for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company. Classes were initially held in the Mount Morgan School of Arts building in Morgan Street, starting with an enrolment of eight. The Technical College was overseen by a committee, which commenced fundraising for a building in 1905.

Technical education in Queensland grew and evolved after the first technical college was established in Brisbane in 1882. Technical education developed out of the Mechanics Institute and School of Arts movements which arose in Great Britain in the early 19th century, initially "to instruct artisans in the scientific principles of arts and manufactures". In 1902, the 17 technical colleges in Queensland established a Board of Technical Education to advise the Minister for Public Instruction. In 1905, this Board was abolished and a separate branch of the Department of Public Instruction created to oversee technical education. The total number of technical education students enrolled in Queensland in 1905 was 4171 and the state subsidy for technical education was more than £6204.

In 1906, the Mount Morgan Technical College Committee realised that a new building for the expanding college would be costly, so the institution should be responsible to the Queensland Government rather than the School of Arts. The Committee drew up a constitution that was adopted by the School of Arts Committee on 31 May 1906 and subsequently by the government. The college's new board had 12 members - three appointed by the government; four appointed by Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company; two elected by subscribers of 5s and over; two elected by students of certain standing; and one appointed by subscribers of £250 or more.

Queensland's private schools, technical colleges and schools of arts were not built to a standard plan, but were individually designed with variation in style, size and form. Plans for the Technical College Building (now known as Block A) were prepared in the office of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company. The design was approved by the college's board and the Department of Public Works, and the contract for erection of the building was awarded to J K Evans of Rockhampton in November 1907, with Arthur Jenks appointed Clerk of Works. By 1908 enrolments in the Mount Morgan technical education classes had increased to 323 and classes were conducted in various building around the town, attesting to the need for a site dedicated to the technical college.

The Mount Morgan Technical College Building, located on the corner of Central and Dee Streets, was completed at the end of 1908. Wherever possible, the building was constructed from materials obtained in Queensland. The bricks were supplied by the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company and made at the company's brickworks (known locally as Gunthorpe's brickworks after its long-term manager, Robert Gunthorpe), situated behind the Mount Morgan railway station. The stone came from G Sanderson's quarry at Stanwell, while all the timber used in the building was Australian. The furniture was specially designed and manufactured in Rockhampton by W A Lawson.

After the building's completion, The Capricornian newspaper praised the new building and the community:"The people of Mount Morgan are to be warmly congratulated on the splendid Technical College which has now been completed and will be opened in the course of the next few weeks. With the exception of the College in Brisbane and the School of Mines in Charters Towers it is by far the finest college in the state, and as a building it certainly surpasses the Charters Towers institution. The cost is over £6000 and the college will be opened free from debt, a remarkable achievement. The Government … assisted … by a contribution of well over £4000, and the Mount Morgan Company directly and indirectly subscribed £800, besides presenting the land…. The people of Mount Morgan … provide[d] …. [s]omething like £800 in hard cash…"Money collected from the community to build the Technical College Building was raised from functions, "brick-selling" donations, donations from individuals and businesses, plus £250 from Walter Russell Hall, Director of the mine. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company donated land for the site of the Technical College (worth £800); the Secretary's house; another house for the Principal; as well as the Manual Training Building.

Queensland's prosperity from mining and agricultural pursuits in the first decades of the 20th century enabled the government to implement a campaign of construction of large public buildings. This was the case for the Mount Morgan Technical College which received £4 from the Queensland Government for every £1 raised by community.

The technical college was officially opened by the Hon William Kidston, Premier of Queensland, on 24 April 1909. The Capricornian printed the following description of the building at its opening:"The outside of the building… shows only pure materials - brick and stone and timber. No stucco has been allowed in any shape or form, the only plaster being on the inside of the walls of the rooms to ensure … smooth surfaces for the purposes of light and cleanliness. The question of lighting the rooms both day and night has had especial study and we consider the desired result has been achieved. The main building contains seven classrooms - four on the ground floor and three on the first floor - and in addition, a board-room and library combined, a main entrance hall or vestibule and a museum, besides passages and verandah balcony. The rooms have all been designed to suit present and future conditions and include a demonstration theatre, where demonstrations in physics, chemistry and cookery are held. In additional to the main building, practical classes are held in plumbing in what is called the malthoid building and in practical mechanical engineering and carpentry in the workshops of the Mount Morgan Goldmining Company. The total amount spent on the building is £4301 and on equipment £1699, making a total of £6000."
A plan marking the early layout of the Technical College Building shows it as an L-shaped, two storey structure, with the primary entrance facing east and a secondary entrance to the south. An L-shaped verandah, sheltered by a skillion roof, wrapped around the rear (northwest) of the building at ground level, and a roof lantern provided natural light to the southern classrooms on the first floor. The eastern and southern elevations were each approximately symmetrical and were divided into bays by tall pilasters. The parapets of the central bays were taller than those of the other bays; and the parapet in the centre of the eastern elevation featured the words "TECHNICAL COLLEGE". At the time the Technical College Building opened, Mount Morgan's population was approaching its peak of 13,000 reached in 1910.

Dramatic reform of the Queensland education system began around 1909 and continued until the beginning of World War I. During this period a high school system was introduced, technical education was expanded, the University of Queensland was inaugurated, a teachers' training college was established, the requirement for a local contribution towards construction costs for new schools was abolished, and the school leaving age was increased from 12 to 14 years. Although technically compulsory since 1875, school attendance was not enforced until 1900. Subsequently, student numbers rose across Queensland during the first 15 years of the 20th century.

In Queensland, governments were slow to establish state secondary education, considering it to be of little relevance to Queensland's economy which was based on primary industries. The Grammar Schools Act 1860 provided scholarships for high-achieving students to attend elite grammar schools, although few were awarded. It was not until 1912 that the government instituted a high school system, whereby separate high schools were established in major towns or, where the student population was too small, a primary school was expanded to include a "high top". In Queensland generally, high schools remained few in number until after World War II.

The first high schools were established within existing technical colleges, utilising their buildings. This was the case in Mount Morgan when, on 12 February 1912, Mount Morgan State High School opened in the Technical College Building as one of the six first state high schools in Queensland. Opened by Norman F White, Chairman of the Board and Chief Engineer for the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company Limited, the high school initially enrolled 87 pupils. The Technical College continued to operate in the building.

To accommodate the transition from a technical college to a shared facility, the interior of the Technical College Building at Mount Morgan was altered. A 1912 plan, signed off by Thomas Pye, the Deputy Government Architect at the time, shows these changes. Ground floor alterations included: a new partition of glazed shutters and centre-pivoting fanlights added to a southern classroom; a new screen added to the northeastern classroom to accommodate a classroom and "Typewriting and Shorthand Classroom"; and the "Hat and Cloak Room" was converted into a corridor. On the first floor a gangway was constructed over the staircase; the museum adjacent to the stair landing was partitioned off and converted into a library; and the southern, main lecture hall was divided by partly-glazed partitions to create a classroom, dressmaking room and machine drawing classroom. The plan also shows a timber-framed domestic science scullery and ladies cloak room added to the northern end of the rear verandah, and an L-shaped balcony added to the first floor.

From their introduction, the design of high school buildings was the responsibility of the Department of Public Works. The first purpose-built high school buildings were constructed in 1917 and were large, elaborate buildings that were variations of a standard design introduced in 1914, as well as vocational buildings built to standard designs.

The Government Technical Schools Act had been passed in 1908, allowing for the establishment of vocational education-based studies in Queensland schools. Mount Morgan State High School reflects this integration of technical education into the state school system. A Workshops Building (later Science Block and Workshop and now known as Block B), constructed in 1913, had this purpose. The Workshops Building, a single-storey, masonry structure with a Dutch-gable roof, was constructed in the northwestern corner of the site and was primarily accessed from the east. Its interior was divided into two spaces - a blacksmith's shop to the north and a machine shop to the south - which were connected by a set of dual doors. Each space had a western teachers room that flanked the central dividing wall, and a chimney protruded from the northern end of the building.

By 1913, the school site included the Technical College Building, the Workshops Building, a residence, a large shed and a reservoir.
In February 1918 the Department of Public Works decided to add another story to the Science Block and Workshop. The estimated cost was £2550 and the work was performed by day labour. The ground floor was converted from a machine shop and blacksmiths' shop to a drawing room and classrooms. The first floor addition provided a lecture room, a classroom, a physics laboratory, a chemical laboratory and offices. It was accessed via a set of exterior stairs, in the centre of the eastern elevation, and the original Dutch-gable roof was refixed atop the addition.

In 1923 plans were drawn for extension of the domestic science scullery to its west to include a laundry. The locations of some lightweight interior partitions within the Technical College Building were also altered. Also at this time, the library was moved to the southern end of the first floor; and its former location was converted into a principal's room. In conjunction with this work, completion of 'improvements to the frontages of the college' consisting of "brick and iron fence, steps, gates, etc", designed by a Mr Johns, and a reinforced concrete retaining wall, running north along the Central Street (Burnett Highway) boundary, were constructed in 1924. The brick fence runs along the site boundary, in the southeastern corner of the site. It frames the Technical College Building and flanks a set of tapered stairs that lead to the building's eastern entrance.

The late 1920s brought unemployment to Mount Morgan. The Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company went into voluntary liquidation in 1927 and its machinery was sold. However, former mine manager, Adam Alexander Boyd, raised sufficient funds to register a company, Mount Morgan Limited, in June 1929, to exploit the Mount Morgan ore reserves. Initially income was derived from recovering copper from water in the mine, but falling copper prices and a lack of finance, combined with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, meant that liquidation again looked certain.

In the same period, educational changes occurred. In December 1928, the Mount Morgan Technical College was brought under the control of the Department of Public Instruction, and in 1929 Mount Morgan Intermediate School opened on the site of the high school and technical college.

Mount Morgan Mine began open-cut gold mining in 1932. In that year the Queensland Government decided to subsidise the gold mining industry as part of a scheme to increase employment. This government initiative came at a crucial time for the future of Mount Morgan Limited. So successful was the mine that, within eight months, the initial loan of £15,000 was repaid and further government assistance was not required.

The re-opening meant there was demand for skilled labour again, so classes resumed at the Technical College and the institution became known as the Mount Morgan High and Intermediate School and Technical College. In 1937, Mount Morgan High School celebrated its Silver Jubilee.

The Mount Morgan campus continued to add vocational buildings. By the 1950s the site had acquired: an assay laboratory at the northeastern end of the site; and a carpenters and trade shop located between the Science Block and Workshop and the residence. A 1954 plan shows the location of various concrete retaining walls - one along the northern end of the eastern boundary and another through the centre of the site, between the Technical College Building and the Science Block and Workshop.

The 1960s brought more change to educational opportunities in Mount Morgan. The Intermediate School closed in 1963 and the Technical College closed in the following year. 1968 marked the end of the Mount Morgan High School Past Pupils Association, established in 1924, which had played an important social role in the community and raised funds for improvements to the high school.

Celebration of Mount Morgan State High School's Diamond Jubilee took place on 15 April 1972 coinciding with the official opening of a new classroom block built by the Education Department. Changes at the Mount Morgan mine, affecting employment, took place from the 1970s. In February 1976, staff numbers at the mine were reduced to below 500. In 1981 open cut mining ended when the ore body was exhausted. Smelting ceased in 1984 but extraction of gold from 28 million tonnes (Mt) of tailings took place from 1982 until November 1990.

During the mine's 108-year life approximately 262 tonnes of gold, 37 tonnes of silver and 387,000 tonnes of copper were mined at Mount Morgan from underground and open cut operations.

Changes on the school site by 1997 included: the demolition of the residence and large shed, and the construction of a sports storage shed and games area in their place; the construction of various teaching buildings - one over a section of the central concrete retaining wall, and three others at the northwestern end of the site; and a toilet block added to the northeastern corner of the site.

The school grounds have also increased in size. Between 1972 and 1980 land to the west of the Science Block and Workshop was added. A large lot north of Bedsor Street was incorporated in the school site by 1954 and in 2015 it is primarily used for sporting facilities. Part of Bedsor Street was closed in 1985 and the school site was reconfigured into one lot in 2011. The Mount Morgan State High School's centenary was commemorated in 2012, recognising its importance to the town.

In 2015, the former Technical College Building (Block A) is used for administration and teaching purposes, and the former Science Block and Workshop (Block B) is used as a library and resource centre. The Mount Morgan State High School is important to Mount Morgan, having been a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there. Since establishment it has been a key social focus for the Mount Morgan community with the grounds and buildings serving as the venue for social events.

Mount Morgan State High School occupies the southern end of a 5.213ha corner block within the town of Mount Morgan; approximately 32 km southwest of Rockhampton. Facing east, the site is approximately 0.85ha, and slopes gently down towards the eastern boundary of Central Street (Burnett Highway), the main thoroughfare through Mount Morgan. The site is also bounded by Bedsor Street to the north, Carlton Lane to the west, and Dee Street to the south. It contains a complex of buildings, with the earliest structure, the former Technical College Building (Block A) (1908), in the southeastern corner of the site; and the former Science Block and Workshop (Block B) (1913, extended 1918) approximately in the centre of the site. The former Technical College Building, which prominently fronts the Burnett Highway and Dee Street intersection, is a landmark in its setting and makes an important visual contribution to the streetscape. Other significant elements on-site include: a facebrick fence along the eastern and southern site boundaries; tapered entry steps to the former Technical College Building; a rendered masonry retaining wall along the eastern boundary; a concrete retaining wall in the centre of the site; and a mature fig tree.

The former Technical College Building is a two-storey, masonry structure, with a corrugated metal-clad hipped roof and roof lantern concealed from the street by tall facebrick parapets. It is L-shaped in plan and has a strong street presence derived from its simple and regular massing, grand proportions, and symmetrical composition. An L-shaped ground-floor verandah and first-floor balcony wrap around the rear (northwest) side of the building, providing circulation and access to the interior spaces. A timber-framed, weatherboard-clad former scullery flanks the northwestern end of the verandah and stands on low brick stumps.

The building is elegantly composed of red facebrick walls and pilasters, and sandstone dressings. Its red brickwork is English bond with a light mortar. The street-facing elevations are divided into symmetrical bays by tall facebrick pilasters. The parapets of the central bays on both street-facing elevations are tallest; with the parapet in the centre of the eastern, Burnett Highway elevation featuring the words "TECHNICAL COLLEGE" in render. The building's primary entrance is aligned with this parapet and comprises timber panelled doors with a two-light arched fanlight. It has decorative sandstone surrounds and a keystone inscribed with the date "1908". A secondary entrance is located in the southern, Dee Street elevation. Further access is gained via the rear verandah and balcony.

Most original windows have been replaced with modern aluminium frames. Windows on the eastern and southern elevations are generally casements with two-light fanlights, positioned between brick pilasters; however the central bay windows have arched fanlights, with arched sandstone lintel cappings. Timber-framed, double-hung sashed windows survive in the rear verandah and balcony.

The rear verandah has square timber posts, timber floor boards, a timber battened valance and a decorative timber balustrade of crossed members. The floor-framing of the balcony above forms its ceiling. The balcony has square timber posts with decorative brackets and capitals, timber floor boards, and a raked ceiling with exposed timber structural framing. Most of the balcony's balustrade has been replaced with modern bag-racks, and the timber and metal stairs on the northern and northwestern elevations are recent additions.

Internally, the ground floor layout comprises a central foyer with long, narrow classrooms (formerly cookery and typewriting spaces) to the north, administration spaces and classrooms (formerly secretary and board room, and classroom) to the south, and a large classroom (formerly two classrooms) to the southwest. This southwestern classroom retains an early, glazed bulkhead partition in the centre of the space, supported by a cast iron column.

The first floor is reached by a central cedar staircase with a decorative balustrade. This is flanked on the first floor to the east by office space (formerly library), to the north by long and narrow classrooms, and to the south and southwest by classrooms (formerly machine drawing classroom, dressmaking room and classroom). The south and southwestern classrooms retain early partitions that are half-glazed and lined with tongue-and-groove (T&G) timber.

Most interior spaces have plastered walls with v-jointed (VJ) timber board ceilings with early fretwork ceiling vents. The first floor lecture room retains its coved ceiling, and the roof lantern is visible in the space. A pressed metal ceiling is featured in the foyer space. Skirtings, cornices and architraves are generally early and of timber. Most skirtings are wide and have a detailed profile. Many early, four-panel doors survive, some of which retain early fanlights. Modern lightweight partitions and recent carpet floor-linings are not of cultural heritage significance.

The former Science Block and Workshop is a two-storey, masonry structure, with a corrugated metal-clad, Dutch-gable roof. The roof gablets are louvred and a row of masonry chimneys survive on the western (rear) and northern sides. The building has a facebrick lower storey and a facebrick and rendered upper storey - the colour of the facebrick changes between the two storeys, indicating the 1918 first floor addition. A modern steel ramp has been added at the rear. The front (eastern) stair has been replaced in steel and is sheltered by a wide, modern awning.

The majority of modern doors and windows are modern, although most remain within early openings. Several early, multi-light fanlights survive. All window hoods and modern awnings are not of cultural heritage significance.

The interior of both the ground and first floors are primarily divided into two large spaces by a central, brick wall (now painted). Most walls are painted brick or are lined in flat sheeting. The ceilings of the ground floor level are plaster and those on the first floor are T&G timber boards. Square lattice ceiling vents survive on the first floor. Skirtings are generally simple timber of a simple profile, and cornices are rounded plaster. Lightweight modern partitions and modern carpet floor-linings are not of cultural heritage significance.

The school grounds are well established with a variety of mature trees. A large, mature fig tree (Ficus sp.) is located north of the former Science Block and Workshop.

A red facebrick fence (-54) surrounds the former Technical College Building on the south and east sides. It consists of pillars, linked by walls and metal bars - both the pillars and walls have concrete caps. The fence frames the main entrance of the school; running adjacent to a tapered stair that leads to the eastern entrance of the former Technical College Building. Early cast iron lamps are located on two pilasters either side of the stair.

A rendered masonry retaining wall (1924) adjoins the northern end of the brick fence, and runs along the eastern boundary. Stone and concrete retaining walls (pre-1954), with a central stair, also survive east of the former Science Block and Workshop.

Through its prominent corner location, large scale and limited material pallet, the former Technical College Building has landmark attributes and makes an important contribution to the Burnett Highway streetscape.

Expansive views to both the Mount Morgan Mine Site and the surrounding townscape are obtained from within the school grounds and from the school buildings.

Mount Morgan State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2015 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

Mount Morgan State High School is important in demonstrating the evolution of state and technical education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains: an excellent example of a purpose-designed Technical College Building (1908), which was erected to facilitate the training of a skilled workforce for Mount Morgan's mine; and a Department of Public Works-designed Science Block and Workshop (1913, extended 1918), which was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies.

Constructed during the first two decades of the 20th century, Mount Morgan State High School is also important in demonstrating the significance of mining in colonial and early 20th century Queensland. Mount Morgan was a major mining area, which is reflected in the quality and size of the Technical College Building and the Science Block and Workshop.

Mount Morgan State High School, as one of the first six state high schools in Queensland, is important in demonstrating the pattern of development of secondary education in Queensland. The school also demonstrates the way secondary and technical education were interlinked in the early 20th century, with secondary classes often established at technical colleges.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

Mount Morgan State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland technical college complex from the early 20th century, with later modifications. Technical college complexes were custom-designed, and typically featured separate buildings for specialist departments. Significant buildings at Mount Morgan State High School are a substantial Technical College Building (1908) and a former Science Block and Workshop (1913, extended 1918). The buildings are set within a landscaped site that includes mature shade trees and retaining walls.

The Technical College Building, designed in the office of the Mount Morgan Gold Mining Company, is an excellent, intact example of a Queensland technical college building from the early 1900s. It is a large, masonry structure with contrasting decorative capping and lintels; built in a confident and stripped classical style; with grand and imposing street-facing elevations; and sited in a prominent location within the grounds. The interior layout is functional, with a variety of classroom configurations designed for specialist classes.

The former Science Block and Workshop is a good example of a vocational workshop building constructed for a specialist technical college department. Located away from the main Technical College Building to minimise noise disruption, the building is of masonry construction, has plainer finishes than the Technical College Building, and features chimneys that were associated with workshop furnaces.

The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

Highly intact, the Technical College Building at Mount Morgan State High School is important for its aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, landmark presence and streetscape contribution.

The building's symmetrically composed design, ordered street elevations, contrasting high-quality materials (stone and red facebrick), and assertive massing denote a place of learning and stability. Through its size, symmetry, form, materials and siting on a prominent corner along the Burnett Highway, it asserts a landmark presence in the townscape.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Schools and technical colleges have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.

Mount Morgan State High School has a strong and ongoing association with the Mount Morgan community. Established in 1908 with the fundraising efforts of the local community, generations of Mount Morgan students have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Mount Morgan and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Genoplesium validum

Genoplesium validum, commonly known as the Blackdown midge orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid endemic to the Blackdown Tableland National Park in Queensland. It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to thirty five greenish-brown flowers with reddish stripes and a hairy labellum.

"Genoplesium validum" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf with a reddish base and long, fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between fifteen and thirty five flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height . The flowers lean downwards, are greenish-brown, about long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is elliptic to narrow egg-shaped, about long, wide and greenish with narrow, dark purplish bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are linear to egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark purplish bands. The labellum is elliptic to broadly oblong, about long, wide and dark purplish-black with its edges densely covered with short, coarse purplish hairs. There is a dark purplish-black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from December to April.

"Genoplesium validum" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "Corunastylis valida". The specific epithet ("validum") is a Latin word meaning "strong" or "powerful", referring to the robust habit of this orchid.

The Blackdown midge orchid grows in sandy soil in rocky places on the Blackdown Tableland.

Cory Asbury

Cory Hunter Asbury is an American Christian musician, worship pastor and songwriter. He serves as a worship pastor at Radiant Church in Kalamazoo, Michigan and is a member of the Bethel Music collective.

Starting out as an intern with the International House of Prayer in Kansas City, Missouri in 2005, Asbury's career as a musician proliferated as he collaborated with Matt Gilman leading to the release of "Holy" in 2008, followed by his debut solo album titled "Let Me See Your Eyes" in 2009 through Forerunner Music as well as making numerous appearances on IHOPKC albums, with songs such as "Where I Belong", "Shekinah", "All Is for Your Glory" and "Holy Ghost Party". In June 2012, Cory Asbury had moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado to join New Life Church where he began serving as an associate worship pastor, thus becoming a member of its ensembles, New Life Worship and Desperation Band.

After signing with Bethel Music in 2015, Asbury went on to make his debut feature with the Collective on "Have It All" (2016). Asbury became prominent with release of "Reckless Love" in late 2017, a hit single that preceded his breakthrough second full-length album, also titled "Reckless Love", in early 2018 which was a commercially successful release, having charted in the United States and internationally.

Cory Asbury was born on October 15, 1985 to Robert and Janet Asbury and has one younger sister, Hannah. Asbury shared that music has impacted him profoundly from childhood and developed his songwriting ability growing up in North Carolina. Cory Asbury began leading worship at his local church in North Carolina at seventeen years. Upon finishing his high school education at Franklin High School in 2004, Asbury had considered studying at UNC Chapel Hill, but was persuaded by friends who had graduated from the Onething internship with International House of Prayer (IHOPKC) in Kansas City, Missouri to do the same. Asbury began his internship at IHOPKC on January 1, 2005.

Cory Asbury began his career during his seven-year stay in Kansas City, Missouri with the International House of Prayer, starting out in the Onething internship program. He made his first appearance on an IHOPKC compilation titled "Immersed", released in December 2007 alongside several artists including Misty Edwards and David Brymer.
Forerunner Music then released "Holy", a collaboration by Asbury alongside Matt Gilman, on July 10, 2008. The album consists of twelve tracks with Asbury and Gilman performing six each.

On September 1, 2009, Asbury released his solo debut album with Forerunner Music, called "Let Me See Your Eyes" which included appearances by Jaye Thomas, Edwin Botero and Nathan Prior. Produced by Seth Yates, "Let Me See Your Eyes" is an indie pop collection which also incorporated various musical styles including soul, rap and electro. The song "My Beloved", which featured Jaye Thomas, had been released as Asbury's first single from the album in July 2009.

In 2010, Asbury was featured on two IHOPKC albums, "Where I Belong" by Onething Live and "Joy" by Forerunner Music alongside Jaye Thomas and Laura Hackett Park, on both releases. The song "Shekinah", which Asbury performed live with Jaye Thomas and was released as a part of "Joy" in November, became their first "Billboard" chart entry, as it peaked at No. 11 on the Gospel Digital Song Sales chart. Released in 2011, Asbury appeared on "Before His Eyes" by Onething Live, performing "Reason to Dance".

On July 24, 2012, Onething Live released its third live album, "Magnificent Obsession", with Asbury featuring on "All Is for Your Glory" and "Never Gonna Leave Me Dry". This album was Onething Live's breakthrough release, with the album making its debut on "Billboard's" Christian Albums chart at No. 17, and on Heatseekers Albums chart at No 10, credited as IHOPKC Worship.

After spending seven years at the International House of Prayer, Cory Asbury and his family moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado to join New Life Church where he assumed the role of associate worship pastor on June 1, 2012. He led worship on Sunday morning and the Sunday night services as well as the Desperation Student Ministries on Wednesdays. On August 13, 2013, New Life Worship released "Strong God", an album recorded live at New Life Church through Integrity Music, with Asbury singing "All to Him" and "Ascribe". "Strong God" peaked at No. 6 on "Billboard's" Christian Albums chart, and at No. 165 on the "Billboard" 200. Asbury also co-wrote "Fun" with Jon Egan and Jason Ingram for Desperation Band's live album, "Banner" (2014).

In May 2015, Cory Asbury was signed by Bethel Music and become a part of its Artist Collective. On March 11, 2016, Bethel Music then released its eighth live album dubbed "Have It All", with Asbury lending his vocals to the song "Son of God", his first feature for Bethel.

Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series

The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (often shortened to the Cup Series) is the top racing series of the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR). It is named for the current sponsor, Monster Energy, but has been known by other names in the past. The series began in 1949 as the Strictly Stock Series, and from 1950 to 1970 it was known as the Grand National Series. In 1971, when the series began leasing its naming rights to the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, it was referred to as the Winston Cup Series. A similar deal was made with Nextel in 2003, and it became the Nextel Cup Series (2004–2007). Sprint acquired Nextel in 2005, and in 2008 the series was renamed the Sprint Cup Series, which lasted until 2016. In December 2016, it was announced that Monster Energy would become the new title sponsor starting in 2017.

The championship is determined by a points system, with points being awarded according to finish placement and number of laps led. The season is divided into two segments. After the first 26 races, 16 drivers, selected primarily on the basis of wins during the first 26 races, are seeded based on their total number of wins. They compete in the last ten races, where the difference in points is greatly minimized. This is called the NASCAR playoffs.

The series holds strong roots in the Southeastern United States, with half of the races in the 36-race season being held in that region. The current schedule includes tracks from around the United States. Regular season races were previously held in Canada, and exhibition races were held in Japan and Australia. The Daytona 500, the most prestigious race, had a television audience of about 11.9 million U.S. viewers in 2017.

Cup Series cars are unique in automobile racing. The engines are powerful enough to reach speeds of over , but their weight coupled with a relatively simple aerodynamic package make for poor handling. The bodies and chassis of the cars are strictly regulated to ensure parity, and electronics are traditionally spartan in nature.

In 1949, NASCAR introduced the Strictly Stock division, after sanctioning Modified and Roadster division races in 1948. Eight races were run on seven dirt ovals and on the Daytona Beach beach/street course.

The first NASCAR "Strictly Stock" race was held at Charlotte Speedway on June 19, 1949. Jim Roper was declared the winner of that race after Glenn Dunaway was disqualified for having altered the rear springs on his car; the first series champion was Red Byron. The division was renamed "Grand National" for the 1950 season, reflecting NASCAR's intent to make the sport more professional and prestigious. It retained this name until 1971. The 1949 Strictly Stock season is regarded in NASCAR's record books as the first season of GN/Cup history. Martinsville Speedway is the only track on the 1949 schedule that remains on the current schedule.
Rather than having a fixed schedule of one race per weekend with most entrants appearing at every event, the Grand National schedule has included over sixty events in some years. Often there are two or three races on the same weekend and occasionally two races on the same day in different states.

In the early years, most Grand National races were held on dirt-surfaced short oval tracks that ranged in lap length from under a quarter-mile to over a half-mile, or on dirt fairgrounds ovals usually ranging from a half-mile to a mile in lap length. One hundred ninety-eight of the first 221 Grand National races were run on dirt tracks. Darlington Raceway, opened in 1950, was the first completely paved track on the circuit over one mile (1.6 km) long. In 1959, when Daytona International Speedway was opened, the schedule still had more races on dirt racetracks than on paved ones. In the 1960s as superspeedways were built and old dirt tracks were paved, the number of races run on dirt tracks was reduced.

The last NASCAR race on a dirt track was held on September 30, 1970 at the half-mile State Fairgrounds Speedway in Raleigh, North Carolina. Richard Petty won that race in a Plymouth that had been sold by Petty Enterprises to Don Robertson and rented back by Petty Enterprises for the race.

Between 1971 and 2003, NASCAR's premier series was called the Winston Cup Series. It was sponsored by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company cigarette brand Winston. In 1971, the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banned television advertising of cigarettes. As a result, tobacco companies began to sponsor sporting events as a way to spend their excess advertising dollars and to circumvent the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act's ban on television advertising. RJR's sponsorship became more controversial in the wake of the 1998 Tobacco Industry Settlement that sharply restricted avenues for tobacco advertising, including sports sponsorships.

The changes that resulted from RJR's involvement in the series as well as from the reduction in schedule from 48 to 31 races per year established 1972 as the beginning of NASCAR's "modern era." The season was made shorter, and the points system was modified several times during the next four years. Races on dirt tracks and on oval tracks shorter than 250 miles (402 kilometers) were removed from the schedule, and transferred to the short-lived NASCAR Grand National East Series. NASCAR's founder, Bill France Sr., turned over control of NASCAR to his oldest son, Bill France Jr. In August 1974, France Jr. asked series publicist Bob Latford to design a points system with equal points being awarded for all races regardless of length or prize money. This system ensured that the top drivers would have to compete in all the races in order to become the series champion. This system remained unchanged from 1975 until the Chase for the Championship was instituted in 2004.
Since 1982, the Daytona 500 has been the first non-exhibition race of the year.

ABC Sports aired partial or full live telecasts of Grand National races from Talladega, North Wilkesboro, Darlington, Charlotte, and Nashville in 1970. Because these events were perceived as less exciting than many Grand National races, ABC abandoned its live coverage. Races were instead broadcast, delayed and edited, on the ABC sports variety show "Wide World of Sports".

In 1979, the Daytona 500 became the first stock car race that was nationally televised from flag to flag on CBS. The leaders going into the last lap, Cale Yarborough and Donnie Allison, wrecked on the backstretch while dicing for the lead, allowing Richard Petty to pass them both for the win. Immediately, Yarborough, Allison, and Allison's brother Bobby were engaged in a fistfight on national television. This underlined the drama and emotion of the sport and increased its broadcast marketability. Fortunately for NASCAR, the race coincided with a major snowstorm along the United States' eastern seaboard, successfully introducing the sport to a captive audience.

In 1981, an awards banquet began to be held in New York City on the first Friday evening in December. The first banquets were held in the Waldorf-Astoria's Starlight Room and in 1985 were moved to the much larger Grand Ballroom. But in 2001, the banquet portion was dropped in favor of a simpler awards ceremony. And in 2002, the awards ceremony was moved to the Hammerstein Ballroom at the Manhattan Center. However, in 2003, the festivities returned to the Waldorf's Grand Ballroom, and the banquet format was reinstated.

In 1985, Winston introduced a new awards program called the Winston Million. From 1985 to 1997, any driver who won three of the four most prestigious races in the series was given one million dollars. The prize was only won twice; Bill Elliott won in 1985, Darrell Waltrip nearly won in 1989, Dale Jarrett nearly won in 1996, and Jeff Gordon won in 1997. The Winston Million was replaced with a similar program, the Winston No Bull Five, in 1998. This program awarded one million dollars to any driver who won a prestigious race after finishing in the top five of the most previous prestigious race.

The series underwent a large boom in popularity in the 1990s. In 1994, NASCAR held the first Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Between 1997 and 1998, the winner's prize money for the Daytona 500 tripled. This coincided with a decline of popularity in American Championship Car Racing.

In 1999, NASCAR made a new agreement with Fox Broadcasting, Turner Broadcasting, and NBC. The contract, signed for eight years for Fox and six years for NBC and Turner, was valued at $2.4 billion.

In 2001, Pixar visited NASCAR tracks as research for the 2006 animated film "Cars", which included the voices of NASCAR drivers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr. To avoid advertising tobacco in a Disney film, "Piston Cup" served as Pixar's allusion to the Winston Cup.

At the end of 2003, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco's sponsorship contract expired, and NASCAR negotiated a contract with Nextel, a telecommunications company. In 2004, the series became known as the Nextel Cup Series.

The 2006 merger between Sprint and Nextel resulted in the Cup Series being renamed the Sprint Cup, beginning with the 2008 season.

The Sprint Cup trophy was designed by Tiffany & Co. and is silver, with a pair of checkered flags in flight.

By 2009, the popularity boom of the 1990s had ended, and television ratings over the previous ten years had become more or less stagnant. Some long-time fans have criticized the series for losing its traditional appeal because of abandoning venues in the southeastern United States in favor of newer markets. They have also voiced discontent over Toyota's presence in the series. Japanese telecommunications corporation SoftBank acquired Sprint in July 2013. While NASCAR was suspicious of diversity promotion and aware of the negative implications of the redneck image, it also recognized the opportunities to expand the sport. NASCAR CEO Brian France has become a prime target for criticism among fans.

In 2016, NASCAR announced the creation of a charter system, which would guarantee 36 teams entry to all 36 races. Eligibility for a charter would depend on a team's attempts to qualify for every race within the previous three seasons. In conjunction with this rule, NASCAR also reduced the size of the Cup field to 40 cars.

Along with the change in title sponsorship for the series, the 2004 season also introduced a new system for determining the series champion, influenced by the system used in the USAR Hooters Pro Cup Series.

Originally known as the "Chase for the Nextel Cup" (or simply ""The Chase"", and later changed to Sprint branding), the ten highest-scoring drivers and teams (plus ties) in the first 26 races of the season became eligible to win the championship by competing in a playoff held within the final ten races. This number was increased to 12 teams in 2007. The Chase participants had their points increased to a level mathematically unattainable by anyone outside this field (roughly 1,800 points ahead of the first driver outside the Chase). From the inaugural Chase in 2004 to the 2006 Chase, the drivers were seeded based on points position at the end of the regular season, with first place starting with 5,050 points and tenth place starting with 5,005. From 2007 to 2010, the points totals of each driver who made the Chase were reset to 5,000 points, plus ten additional points for each race victory during the first 26 races. Points would still be awarded as usual during the affected races. The driver leading in points after the 36th race would be declared the champion.

As part of a major change in the points system that took effect in 2011, the qualifying criteria and the points reset were changed as well. From 2011 to 2013, the ten drivers with the most points automatically qualified for the Chase. They were joined by two "wild card" qualifiers, specifically the two drivers with the most race wins who were ranked between 11th and 20th in drivers' points. Their base point totals were then reset to 2,000 points, a level more than 1,000 points higher than that of the first driver outside the Chase. (Under the new point system, a race winner can earn a maximum of 48 points, as opposed to 195 in the pre-2011 system.) The ten automatic qualifiers received a bonus of three points for each win during the regular season, while the two wild card qualifiers received no such bonus. As in the past, the race layouts for the remaining ten races were the same, with no changes to the scoring system. On November 20, 2011, Tony Stewart and Carl Edwards ended the season in a first-ever points tie. Stewart's five season wins over Edwards' one win gave Stewart the tie-breaker. Hence he was named the winner of the 2011 NASCAR Cup Series Championship.

For 2014, NASCAR announced wide-ranging changes to the Chase format:

To encourage continued competition among all drivers, a number of awards are given to drivers finishing outside the Chase. The highest finishing non-Chase driver (13th place at the end of the season from 2007 to 2013 and potentially anywhere from fifth to 17th place starting in 2014) is awarded a bonus of approximately one million dollars, and was originally given a position on stage at the post-season awards banquet. The awards banquet now focuses solely on the Chase, with all of the series' sponsored and contingency awards moved to a luncheon at Cipriani the day before the banquet.

This playoff system was implemented primarily to make the points race more competitive late in the season, and indirectly, to increase television ratings during the NFL season, which starts around the same time as the Chase begins. The Chase also forces teams to perform at their best during all three stages of the season, the first half of the regular season, the second half of the regular season, and the Chase.

Previously, the champion could have been determined before the last race, or even several races before the end of the season, because it was mathematically impossible for any other driver to gain enough points to overtake the leader.

The title sponsorship with Sprint ended after the 2016 season. On December 1, 2016, NASCAR announced it had reached an agreement with Monster Energy to become the new sponsor of NASCAR's premier series. On December 19, 2016, NASCAR announced the new name for the series, Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series as well as the new series logo and new NASCAR logo. On April 11, 2018, Monster Energy announced an extension of their sponsorship of the series through the end of the 2019 season.

In 2017, stage racing was introduced. Races were broken up into three stages, four in the case of the Monster Energy Cup Series' longest race, the Coca-Cola 600. A stage consists of normal green flag racing followed by a stoppage on a designated lap signified by the waving of a green and white checkered flag, then a yellow flag. The top-10 finishers in each of the first two stages are awarded bonus championship points, 10 points to the winner, 9 points for the 2nd place car, down to 1 point for the 10th place car. The points earned are added to a driver/owner's regular season points total, while the winner of the stage receives an additional point that is added to their point total, after the reset, if they get into the NASCAR playoffs. The stage lengths vary by track, but the first two stages usually combine to equal about half of the race. The final stage (which still pays out championship points to all drivers) usually equals the other half. Also, a regular season points championship is awarded to the driver who scored the most points in the first 26 races (regular season). This championship does not award any bonus points to the winning driver. Otherwise, the points system and playoff format remained the same.

The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Drivers' Championship is awarded by the Chairman of NASCAR to the most successful Cup Series driver over a season, as determined by a points system based on race results and victories. First awarded in 1949 to Red Byron, 32 different drivers have won the Championship. The first driver to win multiple Championships was Herb Thomas in 1951 and 1953, while the record for the most Championships, seven, is shared by Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt and Jimmie Johnson. Johnson has the record for most consecutive Championships; he won five Championships from 2006 to 2010. So far every Champion has originated from the United States.

The Cup Series Owner's Championship operates in the same manner as the Driver's Championship, except that points are awarded to each individual car. If an owner enters more than one car, each car is viewed and scored as a separate entity. The points in the Owners Championship is identical to the Drivers' list, with one minor exception: Drivers who are not eligible to earn points toward the Drivers' title can still earn points toward the Owners' Championship. An example of this occurred in the first race under the current points system, the 2011 Daytona 500. Under another rule newly implemented for the 2011 season, drivers are only allowed to earn drivers' points in one of NASCAR's three national series. Trevor Bayne, who won the race, did not earn any drivers' points because he chose to run for the Nationwide Series championship. However, he earned 47 owner's points for Wood Brothers Racing (43 base points, three bonus points for the win, and one bonus point for leading a lap).

Before a major change to the points system was implemented in 2011, there was a slightly different addition to the system of allocating owner's points. If more than 43 cars attempted to qualify for a race, owner's points were awarded to each car in the following manner: the fastest non-qualifier (in essence, 44th position) received 31 points, three points fewer than the car in th 43rd position. If more than one car did not qualify, owners' points continued to be assigned in the manner described, decreasing by three for each position. Under the post-2010 point system, only cars that actually start in a given race earn owner's points.

There is a separate "Chase for the Championship" for the owners' points.

A 2005 rule change in NASCAR's three national series, which will be revoked with the 2013 season, affects how the owner's points are used. Through the 2012 season, the top 35 (NASCAR Cup Series) or top 30 (other series) full-time teams in owner points are awarded exemptions for the next race, guaranteeing them a position in that race. These points determine who is in and who is out of the next race and have become crucial since the exemption rule was changed to its current format. At the end of each season, the top 35 contenders in owner's points are also locked into the first five races of the next season.

Beginning in 2013, the rules will revert to a system more similar to the pre-2005 rules. In the NASCAR Cup Series, the first 36 places in the field will be determined strictly by qualifying speed. The next six places will be awarded on owner points, with the final place reserved for a past Series Champion. If the final exemption is not used because all past Champions are already in the field, it will pass to another car based on the number of owner points.

In some circumstances, a team's owners' points will differ from the corresponding driver's points. In 2005, after owner Jack Roush fired Kurt Busch during the next-to-last race weekend of the season, the No. 97 team finished in eighth place in owner's points, while Busch ended up tenth in driver's points. In 2002, when Sterling Marlin was injured, the No. 40 team finished eighth in owner's points, while Marlin was 18th in driver's points, because of substitute drivers Jamie McMurray and Mike Bliss, who continued to earn owner points for the No. 40. Another example was in the aforementioned 2011 Daytona 500.

A Manufacturer's Championship is awarded each year, although the Driver's Championship is considered more prestigious. In the past, manufacturer's championships were prestigious because of the number of manufacturers involved, and the manufacturer's championship was a major marketing tool. In the Xfinity Series, the championship is known as the Bill France Performance Cup.

Up to the 2013 season, points were scored in a 1960–1990 Formula One system, with the winner's manufacturer scoring nine points, six for the next manufacturer, four for the manufacturer third among makes, three for the fourth, two for the fifth, and one point for the sixth positioned manufacturer. This meant that if Chevrolets placed first through tenth in a given race and a Ford was 11th and a Dodge 12th, Chevrolet earned 9 points, Ford 6 and Dodge 4. Starting in 2014, NASCAR changed the system to mimic the Owner's Championship. Under this system, each manufacturer's best finishing representative effectively earned them the same amount of points as that team earned, including any bonus points from leading a lap or winning the event.

In NASCAR's earliest years, there was a diverse array of machinery, with little support from the car companies themselves, but by the mid 1960s, participation was exclusively American manufacturers with factory support. Chrysler, Ford and General Motors were the primary, if not only, competitors for much of NASCAR's history. Plymouth, while somewhat successful in the 1960s with the Hemi, never won a Manufacturers Championship until Ford pulled out of racing in the early 1970s. GM was still using four different brands in NASCAR in 1991, but within three years, Buick and Oldsmobile were gone. Pontiac survived until 2004, leaving only Chevrolet. 2007 saw the first new brand since 1971, when Japanese manufacturer Toyota joined. Chrysler's Dodge brand returned after a 15-year hiatus in 2001, but departed after 2012, leaving just Chevrolet, Ford and Toyota.

Chevrolet has been the most successful manufacturer as of August 2015, with 749 race wins and 38 manufacturers championships. Ford ranks second with 636 victories and 15 manufacturers championships. Dodge is third in wins with 217, Plymouth fourth with 190, and Pontiac fifth with 155. Toyota currently ranks 9th all time, with 74 victories.

Cup Series cars (often called "Cup cars") adhere to a front engine rear-wheel-drive design. A roll cage serves as a space frame chassis and is covered by a 24-gauge sheet metal body. They have a closed cockpit, fenders, a rear spoiler, and an aerodynamic splitter. Fielding a car for one season usually costs $10–20 million. Each team may build its own cars and engines (per NASCAR's specifications) or purchase cars and engines from other teams.

The cars are powered by EFI V8 engines with compacted graphite iron blocks and pushrod valvetrains actuating two-valves per cylinder, and are limited to 358 cubic inches' (about 5.8 liters) displacement. However, modern technology has allowed power outputs near in unrestricted form while retaining the conventional basic engine design. In fact, before NASCAR instituted the gear rule, Cup engines were capable of operating more than 10,000 rpm. A NASCAR Cup Series engine with the maximum bore of 4.185 inches (106.3 millimeters) and stroke of 3.25 inches (82.55 millimeters) at 9,000 rpm has a mean piston speed of 80.44 fps (24.75 m/s). Contemporary Cup engines run 9,800 rpm, 87.59 fps (26.95 m/s), at the road course events, on Pocono Raceway's long front stretch, and at Martinsville Speedway (a .526-mile short-track). At the backbone 1.5- to 2.0-mile tri-oval tracks of NASCAR, the engines produce over 850 hp running 92–9400 rpm for 500 miles, 600 mi for the Coca-Cola 600 Charlotte race.

The front suspension is a double wishbone design, while the rear suspension is a two-link live axle design utilizing trailing arms. Brake rotors must be made of magnetic cast iron or steel and may not exceed 12.72 inches (32.3 centimeters) in diameter. The only aerodynamic components on the vehicles are the front splitter, spoiler, NACA ducts in the windows only, and side skirts. The use of rear diffusers, vortex generators, canards, wheel well vents, hood vents, and undertrays is strictly prohibited. While the cars may reach speeds of about 200 mph (321.8 km/h) on certain tracks, Russ Wicks drove a stock car built to NASCAR's specifications 244.9 mph (394.1 km/h) during a speed record attempt at the Bonneville Salt Flats in October 2007.

NASCAR Cup Series engines carry a Freescale-provided electronic control unit, but traction control and anti-lock brakes are prohibited. Live telemetry is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage and not on the track.

Cup cars are required to have at least 1 working windshield wiper installed on the car for the 2 road courses (Sonoma and Watkins Glen), as part of the road racing rules package.

When the series was formed under the name, "strictly stock", the cars were just that, production vehicles with no modifications allowed. The term "stock car" implied that the vehicles racing were unmodified street cars. Drivers would race with factory installed bench seats and AM radios still in the cars. To prevent broken glass from getting on the race track, windows would be rolled down, external lights would be removed or taped over, and wing mirrors would be removed. The 1957 fuel injected 150 model Chevrolet (known as "the black widow") was the first car to be outlawed by NASCAR. The 1957 Chevrolet won the most races, with 59 wins, more than any car to ever race in the cup series. Before the mid-1960s, cars were typically based on full sized cars such as the Chevrolet Bel Air and Ford Galaxie. Beginning in 1966, mid-size cars including the Ford Fairlane and Plymouth Belvedere were adopted and soon became the norm.
NASCAR once enforced a homologation rule that at various times stated that at least 500 cars had to be produced, or as many as one car for every make's dealership in the nation had to be sold to the general public to allow it to be raced. Eventually, cars were made expressly for NASCAR competition, including the Ford Torino Talladega, which had a rounded nose, and the Dodge Charger Daytona and Plymouth Superbird which had a rear wing raised above roof level and a shark shaped nose-cap which enabled race speeds of exactly 200 mph. The Ford-based Mercury Spoiler powered by a Ford Boss 429 engine was timed at 199.6 mph. Beginning in 1971, NASCAR rewrote the rules to effectively force the Ford and Chrysler specialty cars out of competition by limiting them to 305ci (5.0L). The cars affected by this rule include the Ford Talladega, Mercury Spoiler II, Dodge Charger 500, Dodge Charger Daytona and the Plymouth Superbird. This rule was so effective in limiting performance that only one car that season ever attempted to run in this configuration.

In 1971, NASCAR handicapped the larger engines with a restrictor plate. By 1972, NASCAR phased in a rule to lower the maximum engine displacement from 429 cubic inches (7.0 liters) to its present 358 cubic inches (5.8 liters). The transition was not complete until 1974 and coincided with American manufacturers ending factory support of racing and the 1973 oil crisis.

The downsizing of American cars in the late 1970s presented a challenge for NASCAR. Rules mandated a minimum wheelbase of , but after 1979, none of the models approved for competition met the standard, as mid-sized cars now typically had wheelbases between 105 and 112 inches. After retaining the older models (1977 for the GM makes, and 1979 for Ford and Dodge) through 1980, for the 1981 season the wheelbase requirement was reduced to , which the newer model cars could be stretched to meet without affecting their appearance. The Buick Regal with its swept-back "shovel" nose initially dominated competition, followed by the rounded, aerodynamic 1983 Ford Thunderbird. The Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Pontiac Grand Prix adopted bubble back windows to stay competitive. Amid its financial woes, and after dropping its poor performing (both on the race track and for consumer sales) Dodge Mirada and Chrysler Cordoba in 1983, Chrysler Corporation left NASCAR entirely at the end of the 1985 season.

1987 marked an incredible, but then unfortunate milestone for NASCAR Cup Series cars. The incredible happened during Winston 500 qualifying when Bill Elliott established a world stock-car record when he posted a speed of . Then the unfortunate happened; during the 22nd lap of the race, driver Bobby Allison suffered a flat tire in the middle of Talladega Superspeedway's tri-oval. Allison's car hit the catch fence and tore a hole in the fence approximately long. Several spectators were injured in the accident, including one woman who lost an eye. In the aftermath of the crash, NASCAR mandated the use of a restrictor plate at Talladega Superspeedway and Daytona International Speedway to reduce speeds.

By 1989, GM had switched its mid-sized models to V6 engines and front-wheel-drive, but the NASCAR racers only kept the body shape, with the old V8 rear-wheel-drive running gear, rendering obsolete the "stock" nature of the cars. When the Ford Thunderbird was retired after 1997, without Ford having any two-door intermediate bodies, the four-door Ford Taurus body was used (although NASCAR racers actually have no opening doors).

While the manufacturers and models of automobiles used in racing were named for production cars (Dodge Charger R/T, Chevrolet Impala SS, Toyota Camry, and the Ford Fusion), the similarities between NASCAR Cup Series cars and actual production cars were limited to a small amount of shaping and painting of the nose, headlight and tail light decals, and grill areas. Until 2003, the hood, roof, and decklid were still required to be identical to their stock counterparts.
It was in this time that NASCAR engaged in the practice of mandating rule changes during the season if one particular car model became overly dominant. This often led to claims that some teams would attempt sandbagging to receive more favorable handicaps.

Because of the notorious manner of the Ford Taurus race car and how the manufacturer turned the car into an "offset" car (the car was notoriously asymmetrical in race trim because of its oval shape), NASCAR ended this practice to put more emphasis on parity and based new body rules in 2003, similar to short track racing, where offset cars had become a burden for race officials, resulting in the "Approved Body Configuration" design.

In 2007, NASCAR introduced a radically new vehicle specification known as the "Car of Tomorrow" (CoT). The CoT made its debut at Bristol Motor Speedway in March 2007. Initially, it was only used at 16 selected events. While NASCAR had originally planned to wait until the start of the 2009 season to use the CoT in every race, the date was changed to the start of the 2008 season. Many drivers still had complaints about the CoT, but this new timeline was intended to help teams save money by giving them only one car specification to work on.

The design of the CoT has focused on cost control, parity, and driver safety. The car's width was increased by 4 inches (10 centimeters), the bumpers were re-designed to render bump and run tactics less effective, and the height of the car has increased by 2 inches (5 centimeters) to accommodate taller drivers and increase aerodynamic drag. The driver's seat was moved closer to the center of the car. The change most notable to fans was the addition of a rear wing replacing the familiar spoiler. The wings could be adjusted between 0 and 16 degrees and used with multiple configurations of end plates.

The new rules eliminate the asymmetrical bodies on cars, which had run rampant since the 1998 Taurus release. However, almost all advantages of using one car over another have been nullified. NASCAR requires all CoTs to conform to common body templates, regardless of make and model.

The rear wing remained a controversial feature for several years. Its appearance was often criticized, and it was accused of forcing cars to become airborne in high-speed spins such as the one experienced by Carl Edwards during the 2009 Aaron's 499 at Talladega Superspeedway. In 2010 NASCAR decided to replace the wing with the original spoiler. The switch began with the 2010 Goody's Fast Pain Relief 500 at Martinsville Speedway.

In 2011, NASCAR altered the nose of the car once more, with the splitter being reduced in size and the braces being replaced by a solid front valence.

A major engine change occurred in 2012 with NASCAR's introduction of fuel injection technology. Initially NASCAR indicated that it would transition to fuel injection midway through the 2011 season but decided before that season to put off the change until 2012.

In 2013, manufacturers were given increased leeway for branding their NASCAR Cup Series cars, creating the Generation Six race car. These changes were made so the cars would resemble their street counterparts more closely, as was done in the Xfinity Series in 2011.

All NASCAR Cup Series cars began utilizing a digital dash sold by McLaren in 2016. This dash includes sixteen customizable preset screens, allowing the driver to monitor all the previous info with several additional elements such as lap time and engine diagnostics, for a total of twenty-four data elements. Information can be displayed as a gauge, numeral, bar graph or LED.

The automobiles' suspension, brakes, and aerodynamic components are also selected to tailor the cars to different racetracks. A car that understeers is said to be "tight," or "pushing," causing the car to keep going up the track with the wheel turned all the way left, while one that oversteers is said to be "loose" or "free," causing the back end of the car to slide around, which can result in the car spinning out if the driver is not careful. The adjustment of front and rear aerodynamic downforce, spring rates, track bar geometry, brake proportioning, the wedge (also known as cross-weight), changing the camber angle, and changing the air pressure in the tires can all change the distribution of forces among the tires during cornering to correct for handling problems. Recently, coil bind setups have become popular among teams.

These characteristics are also affected by tire stagger (tires of different circumference at different positions on the car, the right rear having the most influence in left turns) and rubber compounds used in tire construction. These settings are determined by NASCAR and Goodyear engineers and may not be adjusted by individual teams.

Changing weather conditions may also affect a car's handling. In a long race, it is sometimes advantageous to prepare a car to handle well at the end of an event while surrendering the advantage of speed at the start. Rain forces a race to be halted immediately because there is no current provision for rain tires. While rain tires were developed for the series in the late 1990s, NASCAR abandoned them because there were not enough road courses on the schedule to justify the cost of making more tires to replace them as they aged. Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series cars have used these tires in practice sessions, but only the Xfinity Series has used them under actual race conditions. There was, however, one case of a NASCAR Cup Series race being held in the rain. In 1956 a race at Road America was held in rain; Tim Flock won the race.


Presently, the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series is held mainly in eastern states, with only six tracks located west of the Mississippi River. NASCAR Cup Series races are not conducted on standardized tracks; the 2017 season included 21 oval tracks and 2 road courses. The lap length of the oval tracks vary from at Martinsville Speedway to at Talladega Superspeedway. The majority of the oval tracks are paved with asphalt, while 3 tracks are wholly or partially paved with concrete. Although the series historically raced on dirt tracks, it has not done so since 1970.

While some tracks are true ovals, such as Bristol Motor Speedway, over half the tracks currently in Cup competition are a form of tri-oval. Other configurations include Darlington Raceway's characteristic uneven "egg" shape, the triangular Pocono Raceway, and the rectangle of Indianapolis Motor Speedway.

While NASCAR is known for primarily running counter-clockwise on oval tracks, Sonoma Raceway and Watkins Glen International are complex road courses which are raced clockwise. The series' first road course event was held in 1954, at Linden Airport in New Jersey. Since 1963, the series has raced on at least one road course every year.

Courses have a wide range of banking in the corners. New Hampshire Motor Speedway, with 7 degrees of banking, has the flattest corners, while the steepest banking is Talladega Superspeedway's 33 degrees. Tracks also vary in amount of banking on the straightaways, from entirely flat on many courses to 9 degrees at Dover International Speedway.
Race speeds vary widely depending on the track. The fastest track is Talladega Superspeedway, where the record average speed is and the record qualifying lap is , set by Bill Elliott in 1987. The record stands unlikely to be broken, as restrictor plates were made mandatory at superspeedways in 1988 to reduce speeds. The slowest tracks are Sonoma Raceway, a road course with a record average speed of only and a record qualifying lap of , and Martinsville Speedway, a short, nearly flat "paper clip" oval, with a record average speed of and a record qualifying lap of . The average speed of a race is determined by dividing the winner's race time (from the waving of the green flag to the waving of the checkered flag, including laps spent under caution) by the distance of the race. Time elapsed during red flag periods is not included in the calculation of the average speed.

Dhusha

Dhusha is a village Development Committee in Dhading District in the Bagmati Zone of central Nepal. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 7190 . The Dhusha VDC office is located at Charaundi Bazar, which is one of the Commencing place of the White Water Rafting in Trishuli River which started longway back. The bazar is also the main business area for the whole VDC which is located along the Prithvi Highway. Like the general geographical status of the whole country, Dhusha rises from low altitude to medium - high altitude region. Charaundi Khola (Charaundi Stream), flows very close to the bazar.

Dhusha proudly boasts as it is one of the few VDCs in the country which serves the country producing tonnes and tonnes of vegetables all the year round which mainly comprises Cabbage, Brinjal, Bitter Gourd, Tomato etc. The vegetable that are collected at Dhusha Agriculturral Produce Collection Center in Charaundi Bazar, are sent to Kalimati Vegetable Market in Kathmandu and also various cities and towns in the country including Mugling, Narayanghat, Pokhara, Biratnagar, Dharan . The agriculture development and production also helped to ethnic community likes of Chepang Community. 

Tourism can be the next source of income in the VDC as the area is rich with natural resources. White water rafting is the main attraction in the area. "Trishuli River", which is one of the famous river for White Water Rafting in the country, flows in between Dhusha (Dhading District) and Ghyalchowk VDC (Gorkha District). The main rafting spots which are within the VDC are just 80 km (approx.) with some good resorts (Royal Beach Camp, Himalika Camp/Resort etc.)mainly targeted for tourist are opened in the area. The VDC is just 80 km (approx.) from Kathmandu, the capital city. "Nohak Gupha (Nohak Cave)" also lies within the VDC which can be one of the longest cave in the country though it is yet to be publicized and verified. Canyoning in also a major attraction for local and foreign tourist in the VDC. It's one of the gateway to the Chitwan District via walking trail.

Evelyn Thomas Butts

Evelyn Thomas Butts (May 22, 1924 - March 11, 1993) was an African American civil rights activist and politician in Virginia. She is best known for challenging the poll tax and took her case before the United States Supreme Court. Butts was part of the civil rights movement and later became an influential member of Norfolk politics.

Evelyn Thomas was born May 22, 1924 in Norfolk, Virginia. When she was ten years old, her mother, Lottie Cornick Thomas, died and she was adopted and raised by a politically active aunt. She married Charles Herbert Butts in 1941 and her husband served in World War II. The couple had three daughters together. When Charles retired due to a war-injury, Butts worked as a seamstress and took in boarders to make money. The Butts family moved to the Oakwood neighborhood of Norfolk and Butts became the president of the neighborhood's civic league.

Butts became involved in Civil Rights in the 1950s. During her time as the Oakwood Civic League, she helped create the Rosemont Middle School in her neighborhood so that children wouldn't have to ride the bus to the segregated school. In 1960, she was involved in picketing the Be-Lo Supermarket for not employing black people in higher-level positions. She also protested against black people being told to sit in certain parts of the football stadium. In 1961, Butts was chosen to run against the incumbent president of the Norfolk NAACP. However, Butts withdrew when it became clear she would lose.

Butts and her lawyer, Joseph A. Jordan Jr., sued the state of Virginia for requiring the poll tax, filing in November of 1963. Butts' case was that the tax was unconstitutional since it imposed an "undue financial burden" that violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. In March 1964, this first case was dismissed, but Butts filed another case and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the tax. Butts appealed the case and the United States Supreme Court decided to hear the appeal in October 1965. Butts' case was combined with a similar case filed by Annie E. Harper, which reached the Supreme Court first. The case, "Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections", was decided in March of 1966, making poll taxes unconstitutional.

After the Supreme Court decision, Butts went on to register black voters in Norfolk, signing up 2,882 "in one six month period." Butts, along with Jordan and other community leaders, helped create the Concerned Citizens for Political Education group, which became a powerful political force in local politics in the 1970s.

Butts was appointed the commissioner of the Norfolk Redevelopment and Housing Authority (NRHA) in 1975. She would serve on the NRHA for twelve years. In 1982, she was appointed by the governor to the State Board of Housing and Community Development.

Butts ran for city council in Norfolk three times in 1980, 1982 and in 1984, but was never successful. Also in 1984, Butts was a witness in a court trial where she supported an at-large election system in Norfolk.

Butts was forced into retirement from politics in 1990 when she was ousted as the chair of the Concerned Citizens for Political Education. Butts died in her home on March 11, 1993. She is buried in Norfolk's Forest Lawn Cemetery.

On November of 1995, Norfolk named a street in her honor. On March 27, 1996, the city held a celebration to mark the 30th anniversary of the poll tax repeal. During the celebration, they honored Butts and other activists involved. In 2017, Butts' daughter, Charlene Butts Ligon, published a book about her mother called "Fearless: How a Poor Virginia Seamstress Took on Jim Crow, Beat the Poll Tax and Changed Her City Forever". The "New Journal and Guide" called the book "thoughtful and information-filled." The book provides intimate details of Butts' life and her activism as seen through her daughter's eyes.

Starboard Value

Starboard Value is an American hedge fund that was founded in 2002 by Jeffrey Smith and Mark Mitchell with Smith serving as CEO.

Starboard Value began as part of Ramius Capital in 2002. Peter Feld joined Smith and Mitchell in 2005. 

Starboard Value merged with the Cowen Group in 2008, and was Cowen's hedge-fund until 2011, when it went independent. Smith, Mitchell, and Feld all stayed with Starboard.

In 2011, Starboard won seats on the boards of SurModics, a maker of biopharmaceuticals, and Regis, a chain of hair-cutting salons. 

In December 2011, Starboard sought to gain seats on AOL's board, charging that the firm's CEO, Tim Armstrong, was "wasting money by funding the losses at Patch, a network of local-news websites," and calling on Armstrong to "return to shareholders much of the more than $1 billion it received from the sale of its patents to Microsoft in 2012." Although Starboard lost a proxy battle six months later, Armstrong followed Starboard's advice, spinning off Patch and returning the $1 billion from Microsoft to its shareholders. Consequently, the value of Starboard's AOL stock more than doubled.

After accumulating a 15% stake in Office Depot, Starboard asked for its CEO, Neil Austrian, to be fired, and urged that the firm complete its merger with Office Max. Office Depot gave Starboard three board seats. Starboard also called for a merger between Office Depot and Staples, but the Federal Trade Commission ruled against it for anti-trust reasons, and a judge agreed with the FTC's verdict.

In November 2017, Starboard Value took a 10.7% stake in Mellanox Technologies, an Israeli semiconductor firm. Asserting that Mellanox was spending too much on research and development and other expenses, Starboard urged the company to improve its margins. In January 2018, Starboard Value tried to remove the entire Mellanox board.

In December 2017, Starboard Value bought a 9.9% stake in Cars.com, which it considered to be undervalued and potentially salable.

In addition, Starboard has taken activist positions in Smithfield Foods, Calgon Carbon, Tessera Technologies, Yahoo, Brink's Home Security, and Macy's.

In October 2014, after what William D. Cohan of "Fortune" Magazine described as a "brilliantly executed campaign" involving "withering public criticism" of the firm's leadership and "careful courtship" of its major shareholders, Smith effectively took control of Darden Restaurants, a Fortune 500 company that owns Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse. Among Smith's criticisms was that the pasta at Olive Garden was inadequately salted. On the HBO program Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver did a three-minute comedy bit based on Starboard's presentation. As of February 1, 2018, it had been seen by nearly four million viewers. While owning less than 10% of the firm, Smith replaced the entire board and became Darden's chairman. By doing so, wrote Cohan, Smith "fired a shot over the bows of directors everywhere," informing them that shareholders were now in the ascendant, and "managers ignore them at their peril." According to Cohan, "the scope of Smith's triumph with Darden has left jaws hanging open across Wall Street and beyond. Only in a handful of times in the past few years has an activist managed to replace an entire board of directors, and never at a company the size of Darden." After Starboard took over Darden, its stock went up by almost 60%.

From 2002 to 2014, Starboard generated annualized returns of 15.5%. Fully 84% of its activist campaigns have been profitable. Since 2004, Starboard has replaced over 80 directors on about 30 boards.

Genevieve M. Knight

Genevieve Madeline Knight (born June 18, 1939 in Brunswick, Georgia) is an African-American mathematics educator.

Knight was the youngest of three sisters who all became mathematics and science educators,
daughters of a seamstress and a civil service radar specialist.
As a freshman at Fort Valley State College in 1957, Knight was studying home economics when the Sputnik launch created a big push for more American students to become educated in mathematics and the sciences. Knight transferred to mathematics, "because it had fewer labs than any of the sciences", and graduated in 1961.

She completed a master's degree in 1963 at Atlanta University, under the supervision of Abdulalim A. Shabazz,
and took a teaching position at the Hampton Institute, also becoming an NSF fellow, a position that allowed her to travel and meet with other college mathematics teachers. In 1966, she returned to graduate school, and completed a doctorate in mathematics education in 1970 at the University of Maryland, College Park under the supervision of Henry H. Walbesser.

Returning from her doctorate, Knight remained at the Hampton Institute, where she became chair of mathematics and computer science. In 1985 she moved to Coppin State College as a full professor. She retired in 2006.

In 1980, the Virginia Council of Teachers of Mathematics named Knight as their College Teacher of the Year.
In 1993 she was named Maryland Mathematics Teacher of the Year, and the Mathematical Association of America gave Knight a Distinguished Teaching Award.
In 1996 the University System of Maryland named her as that year's Wilson H. Elkins Distinguished Professor.
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics gave her their 1999 lifetime achievement award for her service to mathematics education, outspoken support of equity "regardless of ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic background", and distinguished teaching. She was the 2013 Cox–Talbot Lecturer of the National Association of Mathematicians, one of the member societies of the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences.
In 2018 the Association for Women in Mathematics named her as one of their inaugural Fellows.

Kelly Davis is an award-winning journalist and investigative reporter from San Diego, California.

Davis helped launch San Diego CityBeat in 2002 with David Rolland and was one of the main editors until she left to begin freelancing in 2015. She has covered California laws about sex offenders, and has investigated San Diego's homeless situation.

Davis and Dave Maass released a 5-part investigative series starting in 2013 in San Diego CityBeat about inmates dying in San Diego jails at the highest rates in the state, many of which were preventable deaths. This series won investigative awards and resulted in new policies and training to reduce suicides. In 2014, after the series had received widespread media attention, an inmate hung himself while imprisoned and his widow sued San Diego county for negligence. In 2017, San Diego county claimed they didn't know about any problems with inmate deaths despite the widespread media coverage, and demanded that Davis provide her private investigative "notes, interviews and recordings" to help in San Diego's case against the widow. Davis refused. Many media outlets decried the request as inappropriate and a judge ordered a stay. It's been insinuated that San Diego county is trying to target or punish Davis for bringing negative media attention regarding the inmate deaths.

Davis received national attention in 2016 for an essay she wrote about her sister who had a "Rebirth Party" and used California's new right-to-die law to commit suicide.

Davis is currently fighting advanced breast cancer.

FS Class E.360

The FS Class E.360 were electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS), using three-phase alternating current, built for the operation of the Valtellina line. They were ordered by Rete Adriatica (the Adriatic Network) and were originally numbered RA 361–363. Italian railways were nationalized in 1905 and they then became 
FS E.361-363 They were leased to Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) in 1906 and returned to Italy in 1907.

The locomotives were built for the Valtellina Railway, a 106 km long line with many tunnels and curves. Hungarian engineer Kálmán Kandó electrified the line in the early 1900s using high voltage three-phase alternating current.

The three locomotives were leased to the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) between 1906 and 1907 for the purpose of operating in the Simplon tunnel. The testing of the Simplon line was carried out on 25 January 1906 by a train pulled by a steam locomotive. On the following 26th April, the first test with an electric locomotive was carried out. The choice of the three-phase system was made by Swiss railway technicians after the visits they made to the Italian lines of the Valtellina. The Swiss had no three-phase locomotives of their own at the time so they asked for, and obtained on hire from the newly constituted Italian State Railways, the three new locomotives E.361, 362 and 363. The locomotives gave excellent service on the Simplon line, hauling over 10 trains a day. The only problem was with the current collectors. The original Ganz collectors did not collect current reliably so they were replaced by Brown-Boveri collectors.

Locomotive E.363 returned to Valtellina in May 1907 and E.361 and E.362 respectively in October and November of the same year.

<doc id="56572251" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56572251" title="Joseph A. Jordan Jr.">
Joseph A. Jordan Jr.

Joseph A. Jordan Jr. (1924 - 14 June 1991) was an African American lawyer and civil rights activist. He worked as a lawyer and judge and was part of the lawsuit heard before the Supreme Court of the United States that ended poll taxes.

Jordan was raised in Norfolk, Virginia. He went to the Booker T. Washington High School and went on to the Virginia Union University. In 1943, he went into the United States Army and fought overseas with the 846 Gas Company and the 67th Infantry during World War II. In September of 1945, he was injured when his jeep slid off of the highway into a mine field. The accident caused him to become paralyzed from the waist down so Jordan used a wheelchair. Jordan went on to earn a degree in sociology. He earned his law degree from Brooklyn Law School. Later, he studied labor law at New York University.

In 1954, he set up a law practice in Norfolk. In 1955, when the state of Virginia planned to create a referendum to allow segregation, Jordan filed an injunction to block the vote. When Jordan and another civil rights activist, Evelyn Thomas Butts, were restrained from picketing a supermarket for not hiring black people in high level jobs, Jordan fought the restraining order, but lost. Jordan was involved in several anti-segregation cases in 1961, 1962 and 1964 in Virginia. In November of 1963, Butts hired him to sue the state for requiring a poll tax to vote. The case was dismissed by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in 1964. In May of 1964, Jordan and Butts filed another suit which accused the state of violating four amendments of the Constitution with the poll tax. Butts' case against the poll tax was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States and was bundled with another case, "Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections" in 1966"."

When the case went before the Supreme Court, Jordan argued that the poll tax laws had successfully barred black people not only from voting, but from holding office. Jordan said, "Almost like a magic wand after the passage of this law, these poll tax laws, not a single Negro has sat in the Virginia General Assembly, and not a single Negro has held a single elected state office in the state of Virginia." The decision was made by the Supreme Court in two months and they decided that the poll tax or voting fee did violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

In 1968, Jordan was elected to the Norfolk City Council and became the first black person to hold the seat since 1889. In 1971, Jordan was the only black member of the city council. In 1972, he became the vice-mayor of Norfolk. In 1974, Jordan resigned as vice-mayor in protest, "saying the city is being run by the Norfolk Redevelopment Authority rather than City Council." 

Jordan was appointed to the General District Court on July 1,1977. He was one of only a few African American state judges at the time. He retired from this position in 1986.

Jordan died at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Hampton on June 14, 1991. A public library in Norfolk is named after Jordan. A foundation in his name, the Joe Jordan Foundation, raised funds in his name to build the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Norfolk. The memorial was dedicated in 2000 and had been proposed in the 70s by Jordan.

Cevian Capital is a Swedish investment firm founded in 1996 by Christer Gardell and Lars Förberg, both of whom serve as managing partners. Backed by Carl Icahn, it is the largest activist investment firm in Europe. It has offices in Stockholm, Zurich, and London. 

Formerly called Amaranth, Cevian has invested in such companies as ABB, Danske Bank, ThyssenKrupp, Volvo , G4S, TeliaSonera, and Lindex, and played a major role in the sale of Skandia to Old Mutual.

Christer Gardell is co-founder and managing partner. Born in 1960, he graduated in business from the Stockholm School of Economics in 1984. After working as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company, he was CEO of AB Custos from 1996 to 2001. 

Also holding the title co-founder and managing partner is Lars Förberg. Based in Zurich, he is a former investment banker.

As of June 2016, Cevian had $13 billion in assets under management. As of September 2017, it had about $15.5 billion in AUM. 

In 2006, Cevian launched Cevian Capital II, the largest dedicated active ownership fund in Europe.

The firm invests only in Europe, although 70% of its capital comes from North America. It does not short stocks, use leverage, write open letters, or engage in proxy fights, and it believes in long-term investments. At first its investments were confined to Scandinavia; more recently, according to Zimmerman, the firm's investment focus has been "on the Nordics, UK, Germany and Switzerland," because these countries "have a combination of clearest governance rules in favor of shareholders, good transparency as well as interesting companies." Cevian has not invested in southern or central Europe, Zimmerman has said, "because we don't know those environments and we don't have relationships there, and we can't be certain that the rules, formal and informal rules, are ones that we'll be comfortable with." Gardell has also stated that he and his colleagues need "to know the people, have networks, have a corporate governance tradition we're comfortable with" in order to make an investment. 

In 2012, at Cevian's urging, Cookson, a British engineering firm, spun off its performance materials division, increasing investment value for Cookson shareholders by over 25%.

Emmanuel Odumosu

Emmanuel Odumosu (1915-1988) was a religious sect leader who founded the Universal College of Regeneration in Lagos. A self-proclaimed messiah, his personal beliefs included liberal sexual rights and capital accumulation. Sect members worked in various businesses of the movement establishing a self-contained economy within the movement.

Odumosu was born in 1915 to Jacob Odumosu, his grandfather was Joseph Odumosu, a famous traditional healer in Ijebu Ode. Trained as a carpenter, he served with the Post and Telegraph Department during World War II. An active member in the postal workers union, a general strike in 1945 led to his disengagement from the department. He took on carpentry work and opened a shop on Lagos Island close to Oil Mill Street. However, he struggled as a carpenter and was constantly in debt, he was jailed for six months on charges brought by his creditors. During this period, Odumosu attended various Protestant churches in Lagos, but soon claimed he received visions and dreams from God. He interpreted some of the visions as messianic visions and that he was chosen as a messiah that has come to redeem the world. He began his rebirth by holding evening meetings close to his shop.

Odumosu's early sermons emphasized duality of the world and self-discipline. The natural world which is filled with evil machinations, principalities and powers and a spiritual world, in which he had access. The spiritual world and natural world are in constant battle, with the former emphasized as the redeemer of the natural world. His religious movement started in 1952 at a location in Lagos Island, another major message was self-disciple; consisting of denouncing alcohol, women and tobacco. At onset, initial congregation was small, about 30 members could be counted in 1954. During this time, he instituted tithe giving to assist the poor, Odumosu also encouraged members to fund his evangelical missions. His movement began to grow and better organized, the growth assisted with a donation by a wealthy convert who provided his property for Odumosu's use. One of those properties was in Ebute Metta, where Odumosu decided to settle the movement. Since the founding of the movement, members lived at their own residences, but after the movement to Ebute Metta, Odumosu asked them to leave their houses and live in rented properties close to the church building. Members declared their wealth to Odumosu who took 10% of the tithe and charged them rent. To expand his movement, he began preaching his sermon with loudspeakers placed outside in the church hall, at a location close to Oyingbo Market, where he was sometimes derisively called 'Jesu Oyingbo'. At the new location, he began to emphasize humility and obedience, to initiate new male members, he will whip them with nine strokes of cane. In 1959, he declared himself Jesus, reduced his sermons and began to initiate various business ventures to fund a New Jerusalem. Among the ventures were Jolly Makers and Happy Day food canteens, Deluxe bakeries makers of Goodluck bread, the properties housing this venture were then expanded to include barber shops and lodging. Economy wise, the various businesses provided wages to his followers. In 1960, a schism in the church led to the exodus of most of his members.But Odumosu who had changed from preaching self-discipline to loyalty did not seem to mind, because to continue his business ventures, he needed loyal workers who will serve him.

Odumosu's sexual practices were less conservative than other Christian denominations and he was said to have established sexual rights over many females within his sect.

Odumosu died in 1988.

Lake was the only woman in 2017 to lead an initial public offering in technology. Lake holds a 16.6% stake in Stitch Fix. In November 2017 immediately after the offering, Stitch Fix was valued at $1.6 billion and as of February 2018 was valued at approximately $2 billion.

Lake was born to a teacher and physician in 1983, and grew up in Minnesota and San Francisco. She initially wanted to become a doctor before she became an entrepreneur. She began on the pre-med course, but became very interested in economics and business. She has described herself as "risk averse". She received her bachelors degree from Stanford University. In 2011 she completed her MBA at Harvard Business School.

Lake worked at Polyvore and management consultancy The Parthenon Group. Lake's sister worked as a clothes buyer, and would send outfits to Lake. She describes her fashion sense as "classic with a twist".

Customers of Stitch Fix order “fixes” of five items, selected for them by expert stylists, as a one off or at scheduled intervals, and are subsequently given three days to choose which they want to keep. 

Lake was inspired to create an e-commerce company that "pairs an army of stylists with an arsenal of data to deliver clothing" in 2011. She has combined data science with marketing to grow the business. In 2012, Netflix VP Colson met Lake and dismissed the business model as "whimsical".

Luo Haocai

Luo Haocai (; March 1934 – 12 February 2018) was a Chinese legal scholar, Supreme Court judge, and politician. He served as professor and Vice President of Peking University, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Chairman of China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party), and Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). In the field of administrative law, he proposed the "theory of balance", which has become highly influential in China.

Luo was born in March 1934 in Singapore, with his ancestral home in Anxi County, Fujian, China. His grandfather had moved to Burma and later settled in Singapore. During the Japanese occupation of Singapore, his uncle and the principal of his school were killed in the Sook Ching massacre.

British rule was restored in Singapore at the end of World War II. While a 17-year-old student at The Chinese High School, Luo participated in the anti-colonial movement and was jailed by the British government for more than a year. As he had lost his birth certificate, he was deported to China in July 1952 after his release from prison.

In China, Luo studied at Zhiyong High School in Guangzhou and Wuxi No.1 High School in Jiangsu. He was admitted to Peking University Law School in 1956, and stayed on as a faculty member after graduating in 1960.

Starting as an assistant teacher, he rose to lecturer, associate professor, professor, and eventually Vice President of Peking University. He was also Vice President of the Chinese Law Society and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

In the 1990s, Luo proposed the "theory of balance" in administrative law. According to Luo, the fundamental relationship in administrative law is that between the administrative power and a person or organization. In premodern times, the relationship was unequal: the authorities imposed duties on individuals. In modern capitalist societies, which have established the rule of law, administrative law aims to control the power of the authorities and protect the basic rights of individuals. Although this has been a major development in human society, Luo argued that the system sacrifices efficiency for the sake of democracy and impedes economic development. His proposed solution is a "theory of balance", which seeks to simultaneously protect and restrain both the power of the administrative organ and the rights of citizens. His theory has become highly influential in China, although it is also controversial.

He joined the China Zhi Gong Party (Public Interest Party) in 1992, and became its vice-chairman. From 1995 to 2000, he served as Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, China's highest court. In 1997 he was elected as Chairman of the Party, and in the following year, as Vice Chairperson of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). He served in both positions for two terms (10 years). 

In 1999, he served as a member of the Preparatory Committee for the Handover of Macau.

Luo died in Beijing in the morning of 12 February 2018, at the age of 83.

Concealed Art

"Concealed Art" is a short story by English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse and one of seven stories featuring the fictional character Reggie Pepper. It was published in the UK in "The Strand Magazine" in February 1915, and in the American women's magazine "Pictorial Review" in July 1915.

In the story, Reggie has a friend named Archie, who is an abstract painter. Archie tries to keep his fiancée and later wife Eunice, a serious-minded poet, from finding out that Archie actually draws slapstick cartoons for a living.

Reggie has a friend named Archibald "Archie" Ferguson, an artist whose abstract works are ahead of his time, though Reggie finds them ugly. Archie has not sold any paintings. He confesses to Reggie that to earn a living, he illustrates slapstick cartoons about the "Doughnut" family in a magazine called "Funny Slices". Reggie enjoys the cartoons and congratulates Archie, but Archie is afraid of telling his fiancée, the spiritual poet Eunice Nugent, that he draws cartoons.

Meeting Eunice, Reggie quickly perceives that she is indeed serious and spiritual. He thinks Archie should not tell her about the cartoons and suggests that Archie claim his money comes from B. and O. P. Rails, a company that Archie really has invested in. Archie follows this advice and soon Archie and Eunice get married. Around seven months later, Archie comes to Reggie in distress. The value of B. O. and P. stock has plummeted, and Archie has lost his savings, but his true problem is that he cannot explain his continuing income to Eunice. Archie is unwilling to tell her about the money he makes from cartoons, so the couple lives off Eunice's small private means and moves to a less expensive residence.

Reggie thinks hard about the problem, his manner becoming so distrait as a result that he inadvertently hurts the feelings of his valet Wilberforce, which Reggie makes up for by tipping him two pounds. Eventually, Reggie comes up with an idea. He calls Archie and tells him to claim he obtained his money by selling "The Coming of Summer" to the American millionaire J. Bellingwood Brackett, who lives in London and often buys artwork. Archie follows through on this plan and decides to tell Eunice he was paid two thousand pounds, a remarkably large sum.

A newspaper reports that Brackett paid two thousand pounds for Archie's painting. Eunice had told the papers about the story. Renshaw Liggett, Brackett's representative, visits the Ferguson home to tell Archie to publicly deny the story. Liggett leaves after Archie agrees. He reveals to Eunice that his money comes from the Doughnut cartoons, which he shows to her. Surprising Reggie and Archie, Eunice finds the cartoon hilarious. She admits that she lied about her private means and is in fact an advertisement copywriter. Archie and Eunice share a heartfelt embrace, and Reggie sidles out.

The British and American versions are basically the same. In the American edition, the story takes place in New York instead of London and Archie's painting is reportedly sold for ten thousand dollars rather than two thousand pounds.

The story was illustrated by Alfred Leete in the "Strand" and by Will Grefé in "Pictorial Review".

The British edition of "Concealed Art" was included in "Enter Jeeves", a 1997 collection published by Dover Publications, featuring all the Reggie Pepper stories and eight early Jeeves stories.

Milkman's Matinee

Milkman's Matinee is an American radio disc jockey radio program that began on WNEW in New York City in 1935, with the concept later being adopted by other radio stations. The WNEW show was notable for being (at least in its era) the longest daily program on radio at five hours and for making WNEW the first radio station in the world to broadcast 24 hours a day. The program's novelty and impact were such that it received three pages of coverage in the October 23, 1939, issue of Life magazine.

The "Biographical Encyclopedia of American Radio" credits newspaper columnist Walter Winchell and WNEW general manager Bernice Judis with the creation of "Milkman's Matinee". Judis's entry in the book says, "When authoritative columnist Walter Winchell wished (in print) for a radio station that would keep metropolitan New York's all-night work force company during the wee hours, Judis introduced the "Milkman's Matinee.""

When Stan Shaw began going on the air at 2 a.m. Eastern Time, he made free entertainment available to more than 400,000 night-shift workers in the New York metropolitan area. For six nights a week, he entertained charwomen, bakers, tugboat crews, cab drivers, and others who worked through the early morning hours. Over the years, the program's schedule changed from time to time. In 1960, it was broadcast from midnight to 5:30 a.m. seven days a week.

Shaw played an average of 80 records per program with the help of an assistant. Two teleprinter machines brought in an average of 135 requests per program, with an employee from the Postal Telegraph company on hand to handle the incoming messages. As requests continued to arrive, the station increased the program's record library from its original 10,000 to 24,000 six years later. In January 1942, requests were discontinued in compliance with a wartime censorship code under which "Musical request shows are banned because they offer a means whereby enemy agents can send code messages."

Along with music, Shaw mixed in weather reports, market news, and what "Life" described as "a fresh stream of homey chatter". Shaw used Anson Weeks' recording, "My Very Good Friend the Milkman" as his opening and closing theme for each broadcast.

At times, "Milkman's Matinee" was broadcast seven nights a week. The list below includes those who had only the weekend broadcasts as well as those who had the main Monday-Friday shows.

In 1949, a survey conducted by the Pulse, Inc., rating service found that "Milkman's Matinee" was the top-rated post-midnight radio program in the metropolitan New York area. A 1955 Pulse survey showed that the program had more than three times the number of listeners of its closest competitor. In 1960, officials at WNEW said that ratings for "Milkman's Matinee" were 20 percent higher than those of its closest competitor. That was the program's 25th year, and the station's general manager said that advertising sales over that span were estimated at $2.5 million.

As time went on, the all-night concept had spread to other radio stations, including WPEN in Philadelphia and WBGE in Atlanta. In 1941, a radio columnist for the "Brooklyn Eagle" wrote that more than 20 stations "have copied the idea".

On August 15, 1947, two apparently unprecedented events occurred on "Milkman's Matinee". Art Ford broadcast via shortwave radio from studios of the British Broadcasting Corporation in London, England, as part of a salute to the musical "Oklahoma!". Besides being the first transatlantic disc jockey broadcast, the show also featured the first broadcast of a radio duet between two continents, as Mary Hatcher in New York and Howard Keel in London sang "People Will Say We're in Love". Composer Richard Rodgers and librettist Oscar Hammerstein II were also on hand in the studio with Ford.

In 2013, Metromedia Radio initiated an automated version of "Milkman's Matinee" that was syndicated to radion stations in the United States and 60 other countries.

Cañadón Calcáreo Formation

The Cañadón Calcáreo Formation is a Kimmeridgian to Hauterivian-aged geologic formation, from the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods of the Mesozoic era.

It is a subunit of the Loco Trapial Group, close to the city Cerro Condor in the Chubut Province of northwestern Patagonia, in southern Argentina. The formation is composed primarily of fluvial sandstones.

The formation preserves fishes, crocodylomorphs and some dinosaur taxa, as well as conifers.

The Cañadón Calcáreo Formation is composed mainly of fluvial deposits, that are found close to the Cañadón Asfalto Formation. While originally thought to be part of the Cañadón Asfalto, there is a lack of calcareous rocks, and the geologic faulting and folding is weaker. The Cañadón Calcáreo Formation is overlain by the Chubut Group, the rocks of which lack synsedimentary deformation. The area of the Cañadón Calcáreo also includes lacustrine and palustrine rocks, including shales, pelites, psammites and coarse clastics.

The age of the Cañadón Calcáreo Formation was originally presumed to be Late Jurassic, probably Kimmeridgian to Tithonian in age. However, it has also been suggested to span the entire Late Jurassic, beginning in the Oxfordian, although this could also be because of the uncertainty of the youngest age Cañadón Asfalto Formation. A 2009 study of the palynology from a section of the formation revealed an age that was Hauterivian, which suggests that the formation extends from the Late Jurassic into the Early Cretaceous.

An unnamed brachiosaurid sauropod is also known from the Cañadón Calcáreo Formation. It is known from a single humerus.

Traklosia

Traklosia is a genus of nematodes. The genus was originally circumscribed in 1961 under the name "Robertia"; L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss created this genus for their newly-described species "R. leiperi". The nomen novum, "Traklosia", was created for this genus in 2015 — "Robertia" was an invalid name due to a senior homonym. It consists of three species found in Brazil and Cuba, and they are parasites of millipedes.

In 2015, Ernest C. Bernard and Gary Phillips coined "Traklosia" as nomen novum for "Robertia". The word "Traklosia" comes from the first three letters in the surnames of L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss. Travassos and Kloss had circumscribed the genus "Robertia" for their newly-described species "Robertia leiperi" in 1961. The generic name "Robertia" was unavailable because a senior homonym, the synapsid genus "Robertia", was named in 1948. 

"Traklosia" is the type genus of the family Traklosiidae, which was changed from Robertiidae. The genus "Triumphalisnema" is in the same family. Travassos and Kloss initially placed their genus "Robertia" in a new subfamily Robertiinae in the family Thelastomatidae. George Poinar Jr. recognized Robertiidae as its own family in 1977. In 1989, Adamson synonymized Robertiidae with Thelastomatidae. The family Traklosiidae is thought to be valid according to Gary Phillips and colleagues.

, three species are recognized in the genus "Traklosia". All of them were initially described with the generic name "Robertia". The three species are: "T. cubana", "T. leiperi", and "T. longicauda". The type species is "T. leiperi", under its original combination "Robertia leiperi". "T. cubana" was described in 1984 by S. E. Spiridonov of the USSR Academy of Science. "T. leiperi" was described in 1961 by L. Travassos and G. R. Kloss of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute. "T. longicauda" was described in 1995 by Nayla García, Alberto Coy, and Marianela Álvarez, all parasitologists at the Cuban Academy of Sciences.

Females in this genus are very small. The female reproductive system has only one genital tract. Their uteri are parallel and oriented to their posterior. They bear a single egg at a time, and eggs are ovalish. Their vagina points anteriorly and is in the posterior third of their body (excluding the tail). Males have a caudal extremity which suddenly narrows half-way making its end thread-like. Their genital cone is well developed.

"Traklosia" is found in South America and the West Indies. "T. cubana" and "T. longicauda" are both found in Cuba: "T. cubana" has been recorded in Guantánamo along the "Carretera Central" between Imías and Baracoa, and "T. longicauda" has been recorded in the National Botanical Garden in Havana. "T. leiperi" has been recorded in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro. 

"Traklosia" species infect hosts in the orders Coleoptera and Diplopoda. "T. cubana" and "T. longicauda" have both been found in the millipede genus "Rhinocricus": "T. cubana" has been found in an unspecified "Rhinocricus" species and "T. longicauda" has been found in "R. duvernoyi". "T. leiperi" has been found in the millipede species "Eurydesmus ruidus".

Thirty years ago, Sean’s brother, Sam, went missing. Having since worked his way up and been commissioned as an Inspector in the CID’s Special Investigation Section, Sean gained access to narrow down his search to Bangkok, Thailand in hope of reuniting with his long - lost brother. On one such trip, Sean encounters Lynn, a jaded, self - serving tour leader who makes him out to be a pervert and child kidnapper, and gets him arrested. There they meet Aut, a high - flying, hot - shot Thai Inspector who seems to care more about his image than police work and, at the same time, is suspiciously familiar with the local gangs. Thus their lives collided and become intertwined, and what started as one man’s search for his brother, quickly turns into a dangerous foray into the underbelly of an international human trafficking syndicate.

SS Clan Alpine (1899)

Clan Alpine was a steam ship built in 1899 by the William Doxford & Sons of Pallion. She was the second ship named "Clan Alpine" in service with the Clan Line used on their Oriental routes.

In 1899 Clan Line sold their old steamer "Clan Alpine", and placed an order with William Doxford & Sons of Pallion to build three ships for them (future "Clan Alpine", "Clan Farquhar" and "Clan Urquhart"). The ship was launched on September 22, 1899 (September 25, 1899 according to other source), with Miss Greta Doxford, daughter of William Theodore Doxford, being the sponsor. The vessel was commissioned in November of the same year. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . "Clan Alpine" was assessed at 3,587 GRT and . The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 330 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .

In early 1900s, the Clan Line operated two main routes between United Kingdom and her colonies in the East. The first one was a direct route from the home ports through the Strait of Gibraltar, Suez Canal and to the ports of India and Ceylon. The second one involved sailing down the western coast of Africa first to the ports of South African colonies, then onto the ports of Ceylon and India, and occasional trips to Australia. 

Upon delivery, "Clan Alpine" proceeded to Middlesbrough and from there to Glasgow for loading, where she arrived on November 18, 1899. From there, the ship sailed to Liverpool and Manchester to load more cargo. She departed from Manchester to Bombay for her maiden journey on December 12, 1899, passing through Suez Canal on December 30, and arriving in Bombay on January 13, 1900. After calling at several Indian ports "Clan Alpine" left for England, passed through Suez Canal on February 13 and arrived in Dunkirk on March 3. After unloading the ship proceeded to England and arrived at Greenock on March 15. After a brief stop, the ship left Greenock on March 22, 1900, stopped to load cargo at Liverpool and departed from there for Cape Town on March 29. After calling at various South African ports the ship sailed to Ceylon via Mauritius and arrived at Galle on July 3. From Galle the ship continued on to India including Madras where she arrived on July 28. From India "Clan Alpine" departed for England via Colombo and arrived in London on September 8, 1900 before continuing on to Glasgow which she reached on September 22. She soon departed for another trip, leaving from Liverpool for Calcutta on October 6, 1900.

"Clan Alpine" continued service on both routes through the rest of her career.

On November 22, 1908 "Clan Alpine" departed Liverpool for South Africa. On December 11, 1908 it was announced that "Clan Alpine" was chartered to transport wheat from South Australia to England and Europe. The vessel arrived at Cape Town on December 19, 1908 from Liverpool, left it on December 23, calling at Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth and arriving at East London on December 31, 1908. "Clan Alpine" departed from East London on January 2, 1909 and continued on to Australia. She arrived at Adelaide from East London in South Africa on January 23, 1909 and immediately continued on to Geelong arriving there three days later.

On June 10, 1917 "Clan Alpine" was torpedoed and sunk 40 nautical miles of Muckle Flugga, Shetland Islands on a passage from Tyne to Archangel with a loss of 8 crew by German submarine SM U-60.

AKB48 Group

, or AKB48 sister groups, shortened to 48 Group or ALL48, refers to the sister groups of the Japanese idol girl group AKB48. Based on the same concept "idols you can meet", it currently consists of 5 sister groups in locations across Japan and 6 sister groups in major Asian cities overseas from Indonesia to India and South Korea. The Japan-based sister groups not only release their own singles, but also perform on some of the AKB48 singles and events. They also send participants in the AKB48 annual events such as the AKB48 general election. The sister groups outside Japan release local-language versions of the AKB48 singles. In their early development, they are often supported by temporary, concurrent members of AKB48, such as Jurina Matsui and Miyuki Watanabe.

AKB48's first sister group, SKE48, was formed in 2008 with its theater in Sakae, Nagoya. SDN48 ("Saturday Night"), NMB48 ("Namba") and HKT48 ("Hakata") were later formed.NGT48 was launched in 2015, and is located in Niigata. STU48, the latest Japanese sister group, was announced during the AKB48 rock-paper-scissors tournament on October 10, 2016. It is based on the seven prefectures adjoining the coast of the Seto Inland Sea and they will have a theater on a ship. In addition to the sister groups AKB48 has an "official rival", Nogizaka46, for which its own sister group – Keyakizaka46 – was created as well.

In 2011 AKB48's first sister group outside Japan, JKT48, was announced; the group is based in Jakarta, Indonesia. JKT48 was followed by another overseas AKB48 sister group: SNH48, based in Shanghai, China. On June 6, 2016, AKB48 announced it had suspended its partnership with SNH48 due to contract violations. Following the statement, SNH48 declared that it had been completely independent from AKB48 from the beginning and SNH48 management had never made any form of partnership with AKB48. Three new upcoming overseas sister groups were announced in March 2016: BNK48, based in Bangkok, Thailand; MNL48, based in Manila, the Philippines and TPE48, based in Taipei, Taiwan.

On December 27, 2017, Yui Yokoyama, the general manager of AKB48 and currently the captain of Team A, announced the formation of MUM48, based in Mumbai, India, in 2018, through a Showroom live broadcast.

AKS also collaborates with Produce 101 in creating Produce 48 in South Korea. It has also been rumored that the company is planning to create a sister group in Mexico.

<doc id="56573286" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56573286" title="Frøya (island)">
Frøya (island)

Frøya is an island in Frøya municipality in Trøndelag county, Norway. The island makes up about 63% of the land area of Frøya municipality. The island lies in a large archipelago of islands in the Frøyhavet sea, just northwest of the entrance to the Trondheimsfjorden. The Frøyfjorden lies to the south of the island and that separates it from the large island of Hitra.

The island is rocky with heather-covered moorland as well as marshes and lakes. There are no naturally forested areas on the island. The highest point on the island is Besselvassheia, at above sea level. The southern and eastern coasts are relatively smooth, but the northern coast is very jagged with many fjords and coves. Sletringen Lighthouse lies at the southwestern tip of the island.

The island is connected to the mainland via the Frøya Tunnel which connects it to the neighboring island of Hitra. The island of Hitra is then connected to the mainland by the Hitra Tunnel. 

The name of the island (and municipality) comes from Norse mythology. Although "Frøya" is a variant of the name of the Norse goddess Freyja, the Old Norse form of the name of the island was "Frøy" or "Frey" (the ending "-a" in the modern form is actually the definite article - so the meaning of "Frøya" is 'the Frøy'). Therefore, the name of the island probably has the same root as the name of the Norse god Freyr, brother to Freyja. The names originally were titles: "lord" or "lady". The oldest meaning of the common word was "(the one) in front; the foremost, the leading" and here in the sense "the island in front of Hitra". Until 1906 the island and municipality name was spelled "Frøien" ("-en" is the definite article in Danish-Norwegian).

Brave Frontier 2

Like the first game to the series, it follows the same gameplay format to Square Enix's "Valkyrie Profile", but differentiates itself from the original such as its story-driven plot and gameplay. Players are allowed to bring up to 5 units in each stage with a "friend" unit in quest mode. Players make friends through friend request. Attacking units in a battle rewards the player with Brave Burst Crystals, and Heart Crystals. After an enemy is defeated, the player proceeds the next stage until the boss, which is required to go complete a level. After completing, players are rewarded with Zel and items, as well as acquiring units from each mission. When players complete the entire area, they'll be rewarded with one gem. However, if players fail a quest, they use one gem to continue. Units have the ability to execute special attacks, known as Brave Bursts and Super Brave Bursts. There's also XBB, but to execute it you need certain units in the same party. 

In departure to the original game, the game will be the first to feature a double protagonist system, allowing players to play the story of both main protagonist in the same game. a new mechanic known as Cross Brave Burst is introduced, which requires two or more units with mutual relationship to execute stronger attacks. Also, the game features an improved summoner avatar system and can be leveled up through branch evolution and be equipped with various weapons and items. Alongside the improved summoner avatar system is the ability to raise pets as companion in quests, which like units, can be evolvable to become stronger. The game's director, Eiji Takahashi also stated that standard features such as Frontier Hunter, Trials and Arena will also be included in the game's release. But unlike its predecessor, Brave Frontier 2 has no Gacha system to get new units, and relies more on buying new units using in-game currency.

10 years after defeating Karna Masta and also restoring the power of summoning within the Akras Summoner's Hall, deep in the world of Extas, Fabulaska was arrested for copying data on a research forbidden to be accessed when two strange figures helped him in his escape. As this caught the eye of the Akras Summoners Hall back in Elgaia regarding the discovery of the new world, Noel, Lugina and Roy went to Extas to negotiate with the authorities for the capture of Fabulaska, in exchange for Noel's research data regarding the world of Bectas.

10 Years after, the year is A.I.E 300, a strange group called Neo Orcus were making their move, destroying countless kingdoms and worlds for their unknown ambitions. Though the Akras Summoners Hall are trying to pin their every move, until a strange gate started opening in Grand Gaia as the Summoners's Hall were sent to investigate. In another world in the Kingdom of Zeltabia, Neo Orcus sets their goal on the kingdom's capital of Phirarm, taking down various soldiers as they proceed with their plan in dominating various worlds. As The King ordered the citizens to escape, two main youth tried to make their escape, each of the kingdom's most powerful knights had fallen due to the mysterious black knight's presence. The main character and his childhood friend, Rin, were protecting the treasure rood underground with the help from Augus and Lory as they were then caught by the black knight. But in the midst of their defeat, Augus used a strange orb to open a portal to another world, and Augus told both the hero and Rin to escape with the orb. However, the black knight commanded Shaia to attack the hero and Rin, distorting the portal as both of them were sucked away into the portal and were separated as they traversed into different worlds. Now, being separated from Rin and being found by the Akras Summoners, humanity's survival rests on the new hero and the Akras Summoners Guild in order to take down the dreaded Neo Orcus.

Unlike the music in "Brave Frontier", which is synthesized, "Brave Frontier 2" will feature a real Orchestra soundtrack done by the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra and composed by Hikoshi Hashimoto, Kenji Ito, Minako Seki ,Kaoru Wada, Noriyuki Iwadare, TAMAYO and Tadayoshi Makino.

The game was first revealed at the December 2016 broadcast of "BureNama", announcing the title logo and brief plans regarding the sequel. Takahashi also expresses his deep thanks regarding the success of the first game saying "In the future even after the new series has been released, the BF that is being enjoyed now, will continue to allow for both existing and new players to play it. We're thinking about various ways, but even with going into a second series, it's conversely unthinkable that we'd close off the product we've done so far until now." At the July 2017 broadcast of BureNama, concept art for the game is shown including two new NPC characters: Roy and Sasha a redesigned battle UI for the game and remastered art for the old units. In the 2017 BraveFest in Osaka in August 2017, the official staff revealed more redone artwork of older units and revamping for the original game's Arena system, as well as streaming of the first Prologue Motion Comic. In the 2017 BraveFest in Tokyo in September 2017, more concept art for units and art for the revamped UI system of the game is revealed alongside the Cross Brave Burst between Vargas and Lava. It also shows new units exclusive for the sequel. The game is scheduled to be released in Q4 2017, but is pushed back to Q1 2018 due to technical issues. Alim later revealed the game's first gameplay footage at the December 2017 broadcast of "BureNama", detailing some of the features such as the basic battle system, Summoner Avatar, the Pet System, Cross Brave Burst, and the ability to buy units.

In an interview with "Famitsu" regarding the game's development, Takahashi stated that "Brave Frontier is a titled type, so you can do a sequel in the form of version up, and of course it was an idea. However, in a conversation I have with Hironobu Sakaguchi in the past, I remembered that he said "I think it's okay to put out a sequel or 2 or 3, even on a smartphone game", and as a result of considering various reasons, this time I wen to a sequel with a completely new work like this." He also said regarding the story and main character that "The first Brave Frontier is focused on the hero in Elgaia and Grand Gaia. But the hero in Brave Frontier 2 is a person living in the kingdom named Zeltabia which is totally different from them."

The game then hosted its Press Release Conference on February 12, 2018, which reveals the game's release date as well as several bonuses that can be obtained in the game itself. To also promote the game in Japan, A-Lim collaborated with Toei Company to produce two promotional videos featuring the 37th Sentai series "Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger", which also marked the reunion of the show's original cast members. The first one is a newly produced episode while the other is a parody of the game done in the style of Super Sentai. Both videos were available limitedly in the game's official YouTube Channel.

The game is released on both iOS and Android platforms on February 22, 2018, with the PC version be released on Q3 2018. A Pre-release campaign with various rewards that can be used in the game.

The game was ranked 67 within the first day of release on the Apple App Store in Japan.

Dalby State High School

Dalby State High School is a heritage-listed state high school at 28B Nicholson Street, Dalby, Western Downs Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1953 to 1954. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 August 2016.

Dalby State High School (SHS) opened on its present site in 1954, due to overcrowding at Dalby State School (est.1861) - which had accommodated a secondary department (or 'high top') since 1914. In 2016 Dalby SHS retains six 1950s buildings, and part of a seventh, which demonstrate the evolution of standard government designs:
It also retains its 1950s site planning; covered links; and paved areas associated with Block F; along with a sports oval and mature perimeter trees. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment.

The traditional land of the Barunggam people, Dalby was established with European settlement of the Darling Downs from 1840. Laid out in 1852, Dalby was resurveyed and named in 1853, and its Town Reserve was declared in August 1855. The first urban land sales were held in 1857, and Dalby became a municipality (the Borough of Dalby) on 29 August 1863.

The growing town soon required a school. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales, were continued in Queensland following the colony's creation in 1859. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.

To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.

A school was built in Dalby by public subscription by early 1859, and the Dalby National School (later Dalby State School) opened on 1 June 1861 on Cunningham Street. The 1859 school appears to have been sited elsewhere, east of Myall Creek. In September 1861 the locals voted to transfer the building and land to the Board of Education, to become a vested national school. In non-vested national schools, the Board of Education did not own the building, but usually provided the teacher. From 1875 national schools were referred to as state schools.

Transport improvements had a major effect on the prosperity and growth of Dalby. The extension of the Western railway line from Toowoomba to Dalby in 1868 led to a boom in the town, which had a population of 3500 by the mid-1870s. However, Dalby's population plummeted to 1500 when the line was extended west towards Roma in 1877, and people followed the railhead. Farming was initially inhibited due to a lack of rain, and without refrigeration agricultural produce could not be delivered to distant markets. By 1885 the population was 1296, and this had only recovered to 1416 by 1901. Dalby's population recovered in the early 20th century due to the Queensland Government's enforced break-up of the large pastoral stations, and its construction of branch railway lines, which encouraged closer settlement. Dairying and wheat cultivation expanded, and the development of agriculture led to secondary industries in Dalby. However, the rural economy of the area remained predominantly pastoral until after World War II.

As Dalby grew, so did the state school. A secondary department opened in January 1914. In Queensland, governments were slow to establish state secondary education, considering this to be of little relevance to Queensland's primary industry-based economy. It was not until 1912 that the government instituted a high school system, whereby separate high schools were established in major towns or, where the student population was too small, a primary school was expanded to include a "high top". High tops were an economical measure that provided essentially the same education while utilising already established facilities. In Queensland generally, high schools remained few in number until after World War II.

Over three decades, enrolment at the Dalby State School's high top slowly rose, from 16 students in 1915 to 41 in 1944. Domestic science classes were also added to the secondary department in 1922, and woodwork and commercial courses followed in 1927. Pupils from the wider district outside Dalby also attended these vocational classes, some of which were held at night. In 1934 the high top building (extant in 2016) was shifted, to be parallel to, and slightly behind, the west end of the main school building . Vocational education was a Queensland Government priority to support the development of primary industries; this evolved after World War I into a variety of subjects. Vocational training within primary education began in 1895 with drawing classes and expanded to include domestic sciences, agriculture, and sheet metal and wood working classes. The subjects required a variety of purpose-built facilities and were initially gender segregated. Standard, purpose-designed vocational buildings were first introduced in 1928. In 1936 the Minister for Education permitted students to take vocational subjects in lieu of geography or history in the Junior Examination, increasing the subjects' popularity.

Although closer settlement boosted agriculture, prickly pear cactus was a serious impediment for farmers in the Dalby district, until it was eradicated by the introduction of the moth "Cactoblastis cactorum" to Queensland in the late 1920s. As a result, Dalby experienced renewed growth and prosperity, and its population reached 3500 in the mid-1930s.

There was further expansion of agriculture in the Dalby District after World War II, due to the Soldier Settlement Scheme, which lead to an influx of young farmers. During the 1950s grain and wheat silos were constructed around the district, and a new flour mill was opened in Dalby. There was a related expansion of secondary industries, and an extensive home building program in the town. Dalby's population reached 4385 in 1947, and 6182 in 1954, with an acute housing shortage in town by 1955.

Dalby State School's enrolments grew in step with the town, and extra classrooms were added in the 1940s and early 1950s. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nation-wide occurrence resulting from the unprecedented population growth now termed the "baby boom". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended. Enrolment at Dalby State School rose to 491 by 1945, and to 1024 by 1954. Leslie F Diplock, head teacher of Dalby State School from 1946, and Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Condamine from 1953, was instrumental in pushing for a new high school. In 1950 a member of the school's Parents and Citizen's association complained that the desks were so crowded that the children couldn't move their elbows to write.

A decision was made to provide a state high school for Dalby in July 1953, and building plans were prepared by the Department of Public Works (DPW) the following month. However, a site plan had previously been prepared in 1952. This early site plan showed entrance pathways leading from the Warrego Highway to the west end of the intermediate wing and from Nicholson Street to the east end of the domestic science block. From their introduction, the design of high school buildings was the responsibility of the DPW. The first high schools were established within existing technical colleges, utilising their buildings. The first purpose-built high school buildings were constructed in 1917.

In the 1950s the number of high schools in Queensland increased significantly. The grounds were large, greater than 12 acres (4.8ha) providing ample room for sports facilities. The general classroom buildings were the same standard types as used for primary schools but high schools also included purpose-built science laboratories, domestic science buildings, workshops for woodwork and metal work, libraries, and gymnasiums. These were also built to standard plans but were specific to their use and not a continuation of previous designs.

Also, there was a focus on the fit between the school and its neighbourhood, as well as site planning for expansion and ideal solar orientation. In the early 1950s, architects developed master planning concepts that influenced the design and layout of the whole school. Initially, these plans were broadly based on regular and symmetrical plan forms around a central or prominent axis. This concept was replaced a few years later by architects planning for growth and change. There was a shift away from grid-like layouts to organic layouts. Nuclear plans were designed, centred on an administration/reception building with classroom wings connected to and fanning away from the nucleus. The primary focus was the ideal solar orientation of buildings. Interest was also shown in developing schemes that related to the natural contours and existing vegetation. Unlike the more formal and symmetrical plans of previous periods, new plans were developed that tended to be asymmetrical and more open. The long, narrow buildings were positioned so that the spaces captured between them were triangular, opening out into the landscape.

At Dalby, the site chosen, northwest of Nicholson Street, was previously a 23 acre (9.3ha) Reserve for Park and Recreation, of which 20 acres and 19.3 perches (8.1ha) were gazetted as a school reserve by 1955. The northeast half of the school site appears to have been gazetted for Hospital purposes in 1954, before being gazetted for school purposes in 1955.

The early development of the school reflects the 1950s shift in emphasis from grid-like layouts towards more organic planning strategies, which provided for "ordered growth from a nucleus". The initial school buildings consisted of four highset timber-framed buildings near the corner of Nicholson Street and the Warrego Highway - arranged in three parallel wings staggered one behind the other, aligned just east of north with verandahs along the north sides, and linked by an axis of highset covered walkways.

The southernmost wing (originally called Block A, but called Block D as at 2016) was for the intermediate school and administration, and this building consisted of (from the west) three 24ft by 24ft (7.3m by 7.3m) classrooms and then two 20ft by 24ft (6.1m by 7.3m) classrooms; with a 16ft by 24ft (4.9m by 7.3m) library and reading room at the east end. The three middle classrooms were separated by folding doors. The administration section, attached off the north verandah, included a principal's room and an assistant teachers room.

The high school wing (Block B originally and in 2016) consisted of a small store room and assistant teachers room at the west end; a science room, a lecture room, and a classroom; then a hallway linking to the covered ways; and a commercial room at the east end of the wing - each of the main rooms being 24ft by 24ft (7.3m by 7.3m).

The vocational training wing (originally comprising Blocks C and D, now called Block A in 2016) consisted of two buildings: the eastern one was a domestic science block (originally Block C), with cooking and dressmaking classrooms in the centre, each 24ft by 24ft (7.3m by 7.3m); with a teachers room and girls change room at the east end, and a dining room and laundry room at the west end of the block. The western building was the manual training block (originally Block D, of which only the east end survives in 2016), which had a sheet metalwork room and a woodwork room, each being 24ft by 24ft (7.3m by 7.3m), with a store and teachers room at the west end, and a store and wood machinery room at the east end of the block.

Plans of the semi-enclosed understories of the buildings included a health services room under the assistant teachers room in the administration section, and a drawing room under the east end of the intermediate wing. There was also a timber storeroom under the east end of the manual training block. All the buildings had horizontal boarded cladding and large banks of hopper windows facing south.

The high school wing and domestic science block were built in 1953-4, followed by the manual training block (completing the vocational training wing) and the intermediate wing in 1954-5.

There were differences in construction methods between the wings. The high school wing (Boulton & Paul prefabricated timber school building) and the domestic science and manual training blocks (both Boulton & Paul prefabricated timber vocational buildings) of the vocational training wing at Dalby were imported buildings.The Boulton & Paul buildings were Type F/T1 and F/T3 respectively, the latter being a design for vocational buildings. Responding to materials shortages and the pressures of the baby boom, the DPW imported a British building system from manufacturers Boulton & Paul Ltd of Norwich, England. Based on an 8ft (2.4m) planning and construction module, the prefabricated elements in the Boulton & Paul system included wall panels, ceiling panels, roof trusses and banks of awning windows. The buildings were constructed at many schools across Queensland between 1951 and 1958. Boulton & Paul buildings were timber framed and clad, had a verandah as circulation, and a gable roof. Ideally, they were oriented so the verandah faced north and the classroom faced south but were also added as extensions to existing buildings regardless of orientation. The stairs to the verandah were often semi-enclosed. The building could be low-set, or highset with a play space underneath, and had extensive areas of timber framed awning windows, providing more glazing than had ever been used in Queensland classrooms; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed. Natural ventilation and lighting was abundant. The classrooms were 24ft x 24ft (7.3m x 7.3m), larger than most previous classrooms.

The intermediate wing was a highset timber school building with semi-enclosed stair. From the early 1950s the Department of Public Instruction introduced and developed new standard plans for school buildings, which were similar to the Boulton & Paul buildings but not prefabricated. These buildings were also highset timber framed structures with the understorey used as covered play space. The principal type was a long and narrow building with a gable roof. A semi-enclosed stair connected the understorey to a north facing verandah running the length of the building, with full height timber verandah posts that extended from ground level to the roof line. Classrooms opened off the verandah and had extensive areas of windows; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed - with awning (top-hung) windows to the southern elevation, and double-hung sashes to the verandah wall. This type was the most commonly constructed in the 1950s in Queensland.

The new Dalby State High School opened 2 February 1954, with an enrolment of 67. At this time the floor was still being laid for the domestic science block, and electric lighting was not yet installed. In March it was reported that commercial classes had started at the state high school and that home science would probably transfer from the state school by Easter. In late 1954 it was reported that state high schools had opened at Dalby, Banyo, Salisbury, and Indooroopilly that year. The school was then officially opened on 4 September 1954 by the Minister for Education, George Devries, who noted that enrolments in state secondary schools had doubled from 5000 to 10,000 in the previous 5 years. He also stated that the buildings at Dalby were well ventilated, with a large amount of window space, and a generous floor area. At the time of the official opening the high school had an enrolment of 49 students in Form III and 21 in Form IV, and the manual training block had not yet been built. Grades 7 and 8 would transfer to the new school when the intermediate school building was completed.

Soon after the official opening a working bee was held on the school grounds. Seventy trees, including athel pines, silky oak, and other pines, plus Dalby myalls, and iron bark, were planted on the frontages to Nicholson Street and the Warrego Highway, and by December 1954 a playing field area had been mown, ploughed and harrowed, ready for rolling.

Grade 8 moved to the intermediate school at the new high school in 1956, followed by Grade 7 in 1957. The idea of creating an intermediate level of schooling emerged in Queensland during the late 1920s. This was intended to be a transition between primary and secondary schooling. Intermediate schools also offered vocational subjects: manual training for boys and domestic science for girls. By 1961 there were 654 intermediate and secondary students at Dalby State High School, which taught academic, commercial, industrial, home science and agricultural science courses. However, the intermediate section only operated from 1956 to 1963. Grade 8 became part of the high school in 1964; and in 1965 Grade 7 returned to the state school.

There were a number of changes and additions to the school in the late 1950s. In 1956-7 a highset timber school building with timber floor trusses (Block C in 2016) was added, at a slight angle, to the west end of the intermediate wing. Around this time the library/reading room space at the east end of the intermediate wing was converted into a teachers room and store.

Block C represented an evolution of the DPW's standard 1950s design, replacing the proliferation of stumps in the understorey with a timber truss that spanned the width of the classroom and provided an unimpeded play space. This type was also often fitted with clerestory windows above the verandah roof.  The building at Dalby was designed to have six classrooms, each 24ft by 24ft (7.3m by 7.3m), with a cloakroom between the fourth and fifth (from the east) classrooms, and a northern verandah. However, the two western classrooms and cloakroom of Block C were not built by mid-1957, and the westernmost classroom was not added until 1958, when two additional classrooms were also added under the west end of the block. In the semi-enclosed understory of Block C, drinking troughs were located along the southern wall, and a raised concrete platform was located at the east end.

An entrance link, with stairs up to the northern verandahs, filled the angle between the intermediate wing and Block C. This entrance was constructed in brick and had a skillion roof, and glazed double doors flanked by fixed glazing. The reinforced concrete slab floor extended outside to the south and was surrounded by boiler-plate flower boxes (not extant in 2016). Two brick flower boxes were also created to the rear (north) of the entrance link, and the western box survives in 2016. The original fan-shaped awning has since been replaced by a rectangular awning (post- January 2013).

Entry to the school has changed over time. A 1957 plan shows a pathway running directly from "Dalby-Kogan Road" (the Warrego Highway) to the link between Blocks D and C, which was labelled "proposed entrance". The caption read "Essential classroom accommodation has been provided here without the architectural emphasis to be derived from entrance and other features such as have been planned for this school." This plan also shows an entrance from Nicholson Street, east of the intermediate wing - about where the current pedestrian entrance is.

The pathway (not discernible in 2016) from the Warrego Highway to the entrance link is visible in a 1961 aerial photograph, as is a path (extant in 2016) from the intermediate wing to the corner of the Warrego Highway and Nicholson Street. The current metal arch at the corner, which reads "DALBY STATE HIGH SCHOOL", may date from this period, although the concrete base under the arch was added after 2007.

Other improvements at Dalby SHS in the 1950s included tennis courts, extant southwest of Block C by October 1958, and by this time there were also two toilet blocks north of the vocational training wing, and a school oval to the northeast.

The Queensland Government continued its focus on vocational education during the 1950s and 1960s. New standard types were developed including a brick veneer, concrete slab-on-ground and steel portal frame structure for manual training in 1958. A new manual training building (Block J in 2016) was built in late 1958-9, north of the west end of Block C, linked to the latter by a covered way. The brick veneer vocational building at Dalby contained a staffroom, switch room and store in a skillion roofed section at the north end, with two woodwork rooms and then two sheet metal rooms to the south (each 30ft by 25ft [6.1m by 7.6m]), and a passageway along the west side. The roof was a low gable with clerestory windows between the passage roof and the main roof. There were awning windows on the east side. The portal frames were to be of concrete or steel (the latter was used) and the wall cladding of face brick and metal. The school complex now formed a "U" shape, angled slightly inwards at the top (north).

A new administration building (Block F in 2016), also built in late 1958-9, was linked by a curved covered way to the lower level of the old administration section. Block F originally consisted of a library and passageway at the south end, a lobby, and then a principal's office and store. The building was brick veneer with a low gable roof of corrugated iron. There were paved areas either side of the building, and a cover was added over the paving at the front entrance c.1959. In the former administration section north of the intermediate wing, the assistant teachers room was expanded to absorb the old principal's office.

At the time of the construction of Block J and Block F, the DPW noted that as 'one of the first of the new High Schools, Dalby suffered from the demand for austerity inescapable at that time, but each succeeding addition effects marked improvement and the buildings are gaining aesthetically in the process. The most recent additions add the weight of bricks and mortar in such judicious degree that the "temporary" atmosphere of earlier years is being displaced by a new academic atmosphere of controlled vistas and scholastic dignity.' The new administration building also provided "a permanent entrance to the school".

Dalby State High School continued to require additions and extensions during the 1960s-70s. In late 1961 Australia's first commercial oilfield was discovered at Moonie, southwest of Dalby. Although a hoped-for refinery at Dalby never eventuated, the town received some economic benefits. As local dairy farming declined from the 1960s, beef cattle replaced cows, and Dalby also became the centre of Australia's largest reception, distribution and processing centre for grains. In 1963 Dalby had a population of 7500, with 2365 school pupils (at the state school, state high school, St Columba's Convent and the Christian Brothers College).

In 1960-1 a 40ft (12.2m) addition was made to the west end of the original manual training block (Block A in 2016), consisting of an agricultural science classroom and storeroom. A general purpose workroom, change room with shower, plus a store, were built immediately underneath. The remainder of the manual training block was converted to domestic science, with a kitchen and dressmaking room. The former wood machinery room at the east end became a dining room, and the former teachers room at the west end, adjacent to the new extension, became a rest/fitting room.

New toilet and shower blocks, connected to the original vocational training wing by a covered way, were added north of the school buildings , and a 72ft (22m) addition was made to the west end of Block B, then known as the "science wing". The extension included a physics demonstration room; physics store room, and physics laboratory.

By 1962 the room at the east end of the intermediate wing was a classroom, and Block J's rooms were labelled as (from south to north) two drawing rooms, then metalwork, then woodwork. In 1965 a tuckshop was built under the east end of the original domestic science block (Block A in 2016), and c.1968 a new science block was built east of the toilet blocks and Block A. By this time, Block E also existed north of Block A.

By 1971 a new amenities block had been added northeast of the toilet blocks and by this time the school appears to have had access to a recreation area north of the railway line. Although this land belonged to Napier Bros Limited from 1975, it remained as grass playing fields until c.2003.

In 1972 Block F was reconfigured, when the library was divided into a sick bay, deputy principal and principal's offices, and the former principal's office at the northeast end of the building was allocated to a clerk-typist. The walls of the former principal's office were pushed southwest into the lobby area, while the adjacent store room was altered and also extended southwest into the lobby area, with a small kitchenette formed at the northeast end of the storeroom. The same year a boys locker room was added to the understory of Block B, and a girls locker room was established in the ground floor of the entrance link between Block C and the former intermediate wing, and the flower beds under the entrance awning were removed at this time.

By 1975 there was a "great hall" near the western corner of the school, and a library north of E block; the 1961 toilet blocks had been replaced by extending of the 1971 amenities block, and there were demountable classrooms west of J block and basketball courts northeast of the 1968 science block. In late 1976 plans were drawn for a new locker room and two more classrooms (these were not extant in 2016, and may not have been built) to the understory of Block C, east of the existing two classrooms; while the entrance link between Block C and the former intermediate wing was converted into a storeroom, and a sports store and animal store were added under the 1950s section of Block B. By this time most of the western building of the original vocational training wing was no longer indicated on plans, presumably meaning it had been demolished.

The reason was a fire in April 1976, which had caused $100,000 in damage to the school, and a new building (constituting the western half of Block A in 2016) was constructed in 1977. This replaced all but the easternmost part of the original manual training block. The internal corridor leading from the covered way was moved west, into the remaining section of the manual training block, which was also used to form part of a new textile store and laundry room. At this time the original domestic science block was formed into two textile rooms, with a store and two fitting rooms between them, and the partitions for the small rooms at each end of the block were removed, along with the windows at the east end of the block.

Changes in room use also occurred from the late 1970s into the 1980s. In 1978 the old administration rooms north of the former intermediate wing were converted into boys and girl's health rooms, with obscure glass windows, while the former health services room downstairs became the guidance officer's room. In 1983 the science room at the west end of the original section of Block B was converted to a computer room, while the wall between the former store room and assistant teachers room was removed, creating an annexe to the west of the computer room. In the late 1980s Block J's southernmost two rooms were converted to Graphics rooms, with a woodwork room and a metalwork room to the north, and the staff room to the north became a store room.

By 2016 a number of other buildings had been added to the school, including a music block () northwest of Block C, and a new manual block northwest of Block J by 1990; a new home economics block west of Block E, with new tennis courts further west, and a new administration building northeast of Block F by 1998; and a small building north of Block E by 2004. In 2011 a trade training centre was added northwest of the hall, and by 2013 there was a new building northeast of the 1960s science block and the library had been extended. A Year 7 building was constructed west of the music block in 2014.  In 2016 Block J was renovated, with new interior linings, new windows to existing openings, and new doorways to the eastern side.

The size of the school was slightly reduced in 1996, when the western corner was excised into the road reserve to create a carpark, to the school's current 7.6ha. The Dalby Agricultural College, which opened in 1979 just northeast of the town, was acquired by Dalby State High School in 2011, becoming its "Bunya Campus" with a residential college and working farm. In 2016, Dalby SHS continues to operate from its original site on Nicholson Street. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there.

Dalby State High School occupies a 7.6 ha, levelled site that is located approximately 600m northwest of the Dalby CBD. The site is primarily accessed from Nicholson Street (southeast); and is bounded by the Warrego Highway (southwest), the Dalby-Glenmorgan railway line (northwest) and a light-industrial property (northeast). The school retains a complex of six 1950s buildings (and part of a seventh), located in the southeast corner of the site and linked by covered walkways, with a playing field to the northeast and perimeter shade trees.

The buildings within the school complex which are heritage-listed are:







Evidence of early site planning of the school grounds remains and is typical of Queensland schools during the 1950s, with the long, narrow, buildings linked by covered ways around open-ended courtyard play spaces. Highset, timber-framed Blocks A (north), B (centre) and D (south) have north-facing verandahs and are arranged in a staggered, parallel formation, orientated slightly east of north, linked by an axis of highset covered walkways. Adjacent, Block C is orientated slightly further east and is connected to the western end of Block D by a lowset entranceway. Blocks J and F are single storey brick-veneer buildings; Block J to the northwest is at a right angle to Block C, and Block F is next to the main entrance and faces Nicholson Street.

Blocks A and B are long, highset, prefabricated timber-framed buildings with gable roofs that continue over the north-facing verandahs. A first floor covered walkway connects Block A with Block B to the south. Both blocks have later extensions to the west (Block A, 1977; and Block B, 1962), which are not the Boulton & Paul type and are not of state cultural heritage significance.

The building exteriors are clad in timber chamferboards, including the southern and eastern sides of the understoreys, with the Boulton & Paul sections clearly distinguishable from later sections by vertical timber strips that define each panel of the prefabricated wall units on the first floor. The eastern end of Block B is clad in modern corrugated metal.

Large areas of timber awning windows, with fanlights, line the southern Boulton & Paul walls, with brackets attached to the mullions and supporting the overhanging eaves. The verandahs have timber floors, continuous timber posts, flat-sheeted raked ceilings and enclosed balustrades, which are either clad in chamferboards (Block A) or profiled metal-clad bag racks (Block B).

The Block A-B walkway aligns with the similar Block B-D walkway to the south. The highset covered walkways have continuous timber posts, railed balustrades, timber floors and flat roofs with flat-sheeted ceilings.

The understoreys have concrete floors, and combine open play space with enclosed areas for various uses. The floor structure of the classrooms above is exposed, with timber bearers supported on concrete piers. Windows on the eastern and southern sides are a combination of louvred (Block A) and latticed (Blocks A & B).
Block A includes one Boulton & Paul building to the east, and part of another Boulton & Paul building to the west, and retains its original chamferboard-clad northeast corner verandah balustrade, and bulkheads approximately halfway along the verandah indicate the location of the former domestic science laundry. The verandah is accessed by modern metal-framed stairs, and is enclosed with lattice and metal mesh above the balustrade. Windows along the verandah wall have been replaced with modern aluminium-framed sliding sashes, with fanlights. Classrooms have half-glazed, boarded doors.

The first floor contains two classrooms to the east of the covered way, and two offices to the west, which have a hallway containing steps up to the adjacent extension. The passageway connecting the covered way with the verandah has been relocated to the west, into the remaining section of the second Boulton & Paul building (former manual training), around modern store rooms. An opening formed in the partition between the classrooms has a modern concertina door. The classroom walls are flat-sheeted, with rounded cover strips, and the ceilings have been relined lined with plasterboard.

The understorey contains a tuckshop (1965-77), office and store rooms. The walls are clad in a combination of timber chamferboards, V-jointed (VJ) tongue-and-groove (T&G) boards, timber battens and flat sheeting, and the interiors are lined with flat sheeting, some areas with rounded cover strips. 
Block B has timber stairs positioned at either end of the verandah, with the understoreys of the stairs clad in chamferboards. The stairs have railed timber balustrades, which are also retained on adjacent sections of the verandah. The verandah walls have double-hung sash windows, with awning fanlights, and modern flush-finish doors.

The first floor contains three classrooms and two store rooms to the west of the covered way, and a staff room to the east. Classroom interiors have flat-sheeted walls, with rounded cover strips, and modern suspended ceilings.

The understorey contains a classroom and student café, separated by a store room. The enclosures are clad and lined with flat sheeting, with cover strips to the interiors.

The later western extensions are similar in form to the original buildings, but are not of state cultural heritage significance.

The Block A (1977) extension is set slightly higher, and has a wider verandah. The understorey is enclosed with face brick; a narrow passageway separates it from the 1950s section.

The Block B (1962) extension has a flat-sheeted verandah wall with vertical louvres over fixed glazing. The understorey is partly open.

Block D is a long, highset, gable-roofed building with semi-enclosed stairs at either end of the north-facing verandah. The exterior is clad in chamferboards, including the stairs and the eastern, southern and western sides of the understorey. An original gable-roofed projection to the north is at a right angle to the main building and connects with the covered walkway to Block B. An adjacent ground floor covered walkway connects with Block F to the east.

The southern wall has large areas of timber awning windows and the verandah wall has double-hung timber sashes, both with fanlights. The verandah has full height (continuous) timber posts, timber floors, raked ceilings and enclosed bag rack balustrades, which are clad in profiled metal. Classroom doors are half-glazed and boarded.

The first floor contains five classrooms and a staff room, with the three central classrooms divided by original timber-panelled folding partitions. The interiors are lined with flat sheeting, with rounded cover strips above dado height and on the ceilings. The northern projection has double-hung timber sash windows, and contains adjoining office and store rooms.

The understorey combines open play space and enclosed areas for a staff lounge (western end) and store room (northern projection). The floor structure of the classrooms above is exposed, with the timber bearers supported on concrete piers. The understorey floor is concrete.

A lowset, skillion-roofed uniform shop (former entranceway, 1956) connects the western end of Block D with Block C. The walls are brick, with fixed glazing and battened sheeting flanking a modern flush-finish door. A concrete slab with faceted corners projects south of the entranceway, and has a rectangular modern skillion-roofed awning over. An enclosed cantilevered walkway along the northern side connects the first floor verandahs of the two adjoining buildings; it is clad in corrugated metal and has high-level fixed windows. The interior is flat-sheeted and the ground floor has a modern suspended ceiling.

Block C is a long, gable-roofed building supported on open timber floor trusses. Built in stages, it comprises: four highset classrooms and a cloakroom (1956) at the eastern end; a single highset classroom to the immediate west (1957); and a single first floor classroom and two ground floor classrooms at the western end (1958).

The exterior is clad in weatherboards, including the eastern and southern sides of the understorey. The southern wall has large banks of awning windows along the first floor, and the ground floor classrooms. High-level window openings on the southern side of the eastern understorey are lined with lattice. The two-storey end wall and piers supporting the 1958 extension's verandah are face brick. The gable roof of the 1958 extension continues over its verandah, while the earlier verandah has a lower, flatter roof, supported on continuous metal posts and set below clerestory lights on the verandah wall.

The verandah is accessed via metal-framed stairs, and has timber floors and bag rack balustrades that are clad externally with profiled metal. Classroom doors are half-glazed, and double-hung sash windows, with fanlights, line the chamferboard-clad verandah and northern understorey walls. The western classrooms are distinguishable from the earlier classrooms by their narrower verandah chamferboards.

The classrooms are separated by fixed partitions, with 2-light panelled timber doors at the southern end. The interior walls and ceilings are flat-sheeted, with rounded cover strips (above dado height on the first floor). Classrooms retain cupboards under sloping whiteboards.

The understorey features exposed timber floor trusses, visible in both the classrooms and the open play space at the eastern end. Block C is connected to Block J to the north by a ground-floor covered walkway.

Block J is a long, single storey, brick veneer building with an open web steel portal frame. The building retains its four classrooms, with a passageway along the western side that aligns with the covered way connecting with Block C. A lowset former storage/office wing surrounds the northwest corner.

The low-pitched gable roof of the wing and the skillion roof of the passage are set lower than the gable-roofed core, with clerestory lights between. The roofs are clad in corrugated metal. The eastern and western sides of the building are clad in profiled metal below sill height. Windows on the eastern side of the classrooms comprise modern aluminium-framed sliding sashes, with a continuous fanlight, shaded by an exterior high-level louvred metal awning. New doors have been added to the eastern side of the classrooms. Windows on the western side of the passageway, the clerestory and the wing have been removed (at the time of inspection in mid-2016) for replacement.

The interior has been altered, with the removal of some walls, and the addition of some new partitions. The classrooms have modern suspended ceilings and walls sheeted in plasterboard, concealing and enclosing the open web steel portal frame. The fabric added in 2016 is not of cultural heritage significance.

Block F is a long, single storey, brick veneer building with a low-pitched gable roof. In 2016 it is used as a student services building and comprises: a central entrance lobby and waiting area; two large and one small offices / meeting rooms to the southwest (former open-plan library), with a passageway along the northwest side; and two small office / meeting rooms (former Principal's Office), and a store room and kitchenette (part of former waiting room and an original store room), to the northeast.

The main entrance from Nicholson Street is indicated by a flat-roofed metal-framed canopy and a stencilled, poly-chrome painted concrete slab; it has stained timber-framed wired-glass doors, with sidelights. A ground floor covered walkway connects the western side of the lobby with Block D to the west.

The southwest section has banks of timber-framed awning windows on the southeast side (with fanlights) and along the passageway (clad above externally in profiled metal). Some of the timber-framed awning windows on the northeast wall have been replaced with metal-framed sliding windows.

The interior walls and ceilings are predominantly flat-sheeted, with rounded cover strips. The lobby interior combines flat-sheeted and face brick walls. The wall between the two large southwest offices (1972) is clad in stained timber-veneer. The doors are a combination of painted, stained timber-veneer and half-glazed.

The school grounds are well established, with sporting facilities including a generously sized playing field/sports oval at the eastern end of the site, with perimeter shade trees.

The school buildings are set back from the Warrego Highway, with an open lawn between. A row of mature trees line the Warrego Highway boundary, the oldest being closest to the corner, and a mature bottle tree ("Brachychiton rupestris") is situated adjacent to Nicholson Street. An mature tree is also located north of the west end of Block A's 1970s extension.

The entrance to Block F retains an area of stencilled, poly-chrome painted concrete slab. The main entrance from Nicholson Street, northeast of Block F, is landscaped with modern pavers and garden beds that contain a range of shrubs.

A decorative metal archway (possibly pre-1961), set on modern concrete plinths, frames a pedestrian entrance from the corner of the Warrego Highway and Nicholson Street, featuring "DALBY STATE HIGH SCHOOL" in metal lettering.

The splayed open courtyard spaces between the 1950s buildings, which were formed as part of the 1950s planning, are sealed in bitumen, with large areas finished with modern synthetic turf and sheltered by modern open shade structures. 

Dalby State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 19 August 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

Dalby State High School (established in 1954) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies; set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities.

It is also important for demonstrating the pattern of provision of secondary education across Queensland in the 1950s, as it incorporates all the features associated with secondary education - a high school, an intermediate school and vocational training facilities.

The layout of the administration and classroom buildings, the covered links between them and associated open spaces, reflect the early 1950s introduction of master planning, and the subsequent shift from grid-like layouts around a central axis towards more organic planning strategies, which provided for ordered growth from a nucleus.

The Boulton & Paul Buildings (1953-5) demonstrate the introduction and adoption of imported prefabricated systems by the Queensland Government in response to acute building material shortages and population growth in the post-World War II period. The former domestic science block also reflects the Queensland Government's focus on vocational training as a way of ensuring the state's economic prosperity.

The highset timber school building with semi-enclosed stair (1954-5) and Timber school building with timber floor trusses (1956-8) represent the evolution of Department of Public Works designs during the mid to late 1950s, based on features of the Boulton & Paul buildings.

The former administration building and brick veneer vocational building (both 1958-9) represent a move away from the austerity of the early 1950s to a more permanent aesthetic, incorporating masonry elements. The former administration building, with its entry canopy and poly-chrome painted concrete paving, provided a formal entrance to the school.

The brick veneer vocational building also represents the Queensland Government's ongoing emphasis on vocational training.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

Dalby State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state high school of the 1950s. These include its 1950s site planning; range of highset or lowset timber-framed and brick veneer buildings of standard and individual designs; and a generous, landscaped site with shade trees, and assembly and sports areas.

Following 1950s site planning principles, the school includes six 1950s buildings (and part of a seventh) that all contribute to the general concept of long, narrow buildings linked around open ended courtyard assembly and play spaces. The four earliest buildings are arranged in a staggered parallel formation of three wings, linked by an axis of covered walkways, while the three later buildings are arranged and linked in a more organic manner.

The former administration building; the former entrance link between the buildings addressing the Warrego Highway; and the covered links between the buildings, are characteristic of 1950s school design in Queensland, providing a ground level administration facility connected to the school by a covered walkway, with other walkways linking the classroom blocks.

The highset timber teaching buildings are all good, intact examples of their type and retain their: highset character with some covered play space under; timber-framed, lightweight construction; gable roofs; north-facing verandahs for circulation; large banks of south-facing timber-framed awning windows, with fanlights; and 24ft (7.3m) wide classrooms.

The Boulton & Paul Buildings also clearly demonstrate the characteristics of prefabricated buildings through the expression of their modular construction in the external cladding.

The connected highset timber school building with semi-enclosed stair and the Timber school building with timber floor trusses demonstrate two iterations of the Department of Public Work's standard designs: the first on concrete piers; and the second incorporating timber floor trusses for unimpeded play space. The building on trusses also retains clerestory lighting above its northern verandah roof.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.

Dalby State High School has a strong and ongoing association with the Dalby community. It was established in 1954 and generations of Dalby students have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Dalby and as a focus for the community.

Jack Callahan (Neighbours)

Jack Callahan is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera "Neighbours", played by Andrew Morley. The actor was cast in late 2015 and landed the regular role of Jack. Morley had previously played Spencer Harrington in fellow soap opera "Home and Away" for two years. He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 April 2016. The character departed on 30 March 2018.

When Jack first arrives, he is described as "mysterious" while Morley describing the character of Jack as one with a "clean slate" as he has no family ties or connections to Erinsborough. He fills in for the local priest whilst passing through until he is caught up in an explosion at Lassiter's hotel. His storylines have focused on his relationship with Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) and getting her pregnant whilst devoting his life to being a priest.

His storylines have also focused on his rivalry with Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) despite Morley stating that Jack has a lot of respect for him and feels that he is a good role model for his son. The character made a tough decision over leaving the priesthood and viewers have expressed negative feelings towards his relationship with Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner) with one calling their relationship "disgusting" and another seeing the coupling as "random".

With Paige unsure about whether to tell Jack about the paternity of her baby, Katie Baillie from Metro UK showed her compassion for Jack but later felt that he didn't act like an adult when he gets into a fight with Mark.

On 31 January 2016, Holly Byrnes from "The Daily Telegraph" announced the former "Home and Away" star Andrew Morley's casting on "Neighbours" as John Doe. Morley was asked to film an audition tape after he had received an email from his manager whilst in Cambodia helping raise money and awareness towards human trafficking. Morley began filming in December 2015. Morley commented on working with Paige Smith actress Olympia Valance describing her as "extremely friendly" and of a "great energy". Valance reminded Morley of Demi Harman, who he worked with early on on "Home And Away."

When Morley first got the role, he was not briefed on what his characters true identity was and where the character was going. He also said that his characters alias 'John Doe' was still written on his scripts at times he was filming scenes under the name Jack. He later added that he now knows what direction his character is going in and said "it'll be a big story arc". He also said that the audience will be taken through "a really interesting journey of trying to work out who he is" in finding out what his character is doing in Erinsborough, what significance his character is going to have and who his character will be involved with. Morley added that his character has a "clean slate" as he has no connections to anyone in Erinsborough.

Jack arrives in Erinsborough with no family ties and a 'mysterious past' of which Paige helps him discover. Morley said that "Paige helps him to discover who he is", together they work out why he is in Erinsborough. Morley said, "It's been fun piecing together the puzzle." After he is involved in a fire at the Lassiter's complex in his first scenes, he suffers amnesia. Determined to find out his past, Paige becomes curious in Jack and decides to visit him in hospital, later becoming fascinated by him. With his details unknown, he is given the name John Doe. When talking about John's future identity, Morley described it as "completely off the scales". He also guaranteed that nobody would pick what his character turns out to be. Morley said "It's a good little journey and the audience is going to love it."

He later remembers that he is a Catholic Priest and goes to the police station to inform them of his past and his true identity is confirmed as Father Jack Callahan. Jack is described to be a "man of God" and to have "devoted his life to religion and helping people", with being a "genuine, kind, sincere and loving person". His reasonings for being in Erinsborough were also revealed, with Jack only passing through and staying at a friends house. He was at Lassiter's on the day of the blast off to help someone who had talked to him during confession.

After the explosion at Lassiter's, Paige visits John Doe in hospital, hoping to find out about his past. Mandy Franze (Kristy Best) turns up and claims she knows John and is the love of his life. After Mandy kisses John, Paige is forced to accept that she has lost him for good. Paige falls for John and the feeling is mutual, with Morley describing it as "true love for both of them" and that "Jack has never felt like this about anybody." However with John revealed as Jack Callahan, a catholic priest, Morley also explains that it will be a dilemma for Jack on deciding who he will devote his life to. Paige meets Dustin Oliver (Kevin Clayette), a person from Jack's past, and kisses him, much to Jack's dismay. After Jack dreams of a kiss with Paige, he goes to Father Guidotti (John Orcsik), the local priest for advice. He later prays and asks God for a sign.

After Father Guidotti dies, Jack sees this as the sign he asked for from God, with Jack feeling his death was down to God allowing him to continue his work in Erinsborough. With Paige feeling upset about Jack's decision, she confesses to her mother, Lauren Carpenter (Kate Kendall), that she is unable to think straight around him, vowing to keep her distance. However, after she realises Jack shares the same feelings as her, she decides to boycott the plan and spend as much time around him as possible. Paige later goes to confession and tells Jack of her recent hookups, to show that she has moved on from him. Daniel Killelly from "Digital Spy" commented on Paige's visit to confession saying, "Jack Callahan is probably used to awkward confessional visits every now and again, but this one really takes the biscuit".

After Paige dresses up as a nun, Jack feels like she is making a mockery of what he believes in. This leaves them no longer on speaking terms, but after Paige goes on a hot air balloon trip that ends up crashing, Jack comes to find Paige and the pair sleep together. However, an old friend of Jack's, Simone Bader (Kahli Williams), turns up in Erinsborough and after finding out Jack had slept with Paige, she questions if she is worth leaving the priesthood over.
Paige finds out she is pregnant with Jack's baby, but decides against telling him. When Jack comes to Paige's rescue after she is involved in a car accident, she reveals to Jack that the baby is his. Paige considers leaving Erinsborough to move to Queensland along with her parents, taking the baby away and leaving Jack behind, but ultimately decides to stay. Paige goes back to where the baby is conceived and goes into labour and gives birth to a son, Gabriel Smith (Kian Bafekrpour). Jack along with Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) come to Paige's rescue and takes her and the baby to hospital.

The pair later reunite and sleep together, betraying both their partners. Morley commented in an interview with Radio Times, "At that moment and with Gabe in front of them, everything felt so right and they went for it. That gave Jack hope but afterwards Paige wants to bury it and forget it happened. This hurts Jack who wants to tell Steph, even though he knows she'd be upset, but Paige is not of the same mindset and regrets it." He added, "Most of the feedback suggests fans want Jack and Paige to be together. It was hard playing the Steph and Jack relationship because it didn’t have the substance he had with Paige, so naturally the audience isn't going to believe in it as much. I loved working with Carla Bonner (Steph Scully) as we get on great and hang out a lot. But the audience will want Jack with Paige, though Paige is committed to Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) who is a great guy and a lovable character... Fans will be torn as no one is the villain here, and everyone ends up getting hurt in some way."

After Steph helps Jack look after his son, Gabe, they develop feelings for one another and have sex. However Paige later bans Steph from being around Gabe due to her past mental health issues. This causes Steph to end her relationship with Jack, feeling that he needs to focus on his family and believing that things wouldn't have worked out with Jack in the long run anyway. Continuing their relationship however, Jack realises he is not Steph's priority when 'having a relationship' didn't feature on a list of what she wants to do in her life.

After Steph returns from a Christmas break with her mother, Steph expects to see Jack waiting for her when she returns, however instead he is with Paige. When he eventually sees Steph, he cancels his lunch with her to spend time with Gabe and Paige, but Steph insists she comes along too. She later becomes irritated as Jack's attention is focused on Gabe during the outing. However, Steph talks to her friend Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) about her concerns, feeling the age difference between herself and Jack may be too big. Toadie later gives Jack advice on how he can keep Steph happy in their relationship.

On 25 January 2018, Sasha Morris from "The Daily Star" questioned if this was the beginning of a love triangle between the couple and Paige. On 5 February 2018, Daniel Kilkelly from "Digital Spy" reported that Jack and Paige would have a one-night-stand. Kilkelly also reported that Steph would seek revenge when she finds out about the affair with her ransacking Jack's room at the backpackers in a fit of anger but later confesses to the police of her actions. This brings repercussions for Steph as her planned trip for visiting her son in Fiji is ruined as her overseas visa is revoked due to the criminal charges for the damage.

On 13 November 2017, it was reported by Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") that Jack would "drive" Paige and Mark's relationship apart when he discovers that the pair are arguing. Jack challenges Mark about his behaviour, but without an explanation Mark is forced to steer clear from Paige and his baby.

Later, in December 2017, "Digital Spy" reported that Jack would get into a "violent" fight with Mark in the new 2018 season. After Gabe is kidnapped, with Paige dating Mark, he becomes involved and tensions rise between the pair. With Elly Conway (Jodi Anasta) and Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond) determined to get Jack and Mark on better terms, they decide to get them together with a game of Croquet. But a feud starts to arise and meets its climax when the pair have a "full-blown brawl" in public. Sophie Dainty from "Digital Spy" described the scenes as "explosive". During the fight, Jack's anger causes him to tell Mark how he really feels and blames Mark for his son's recent abduction.

After Paige discusses the "awkwardness", "occasional violence" and how Jack feels threatened by Mark as he feels he is "muscling in on his family", Paige goes to see Jack. When Paige turns up, old feelings arise from their previous relationship and Jack ends up sleeping with Paige. When asked in an interview with "Radio Times" about how Jack feels about Mark — Morley replied, "Jack has a lot of respect for him, he's nice guy and a great role model for Gabe. However he wasn't thinking of Mark's feelings when he slept with Paige, although Jack is upset that he's hurt the guy. Paige truly wants to settle down with Mark, but she knows what she did with Jack and her mind is in two places at once..." On 17 February 2018, Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") reported that tensions may be flaring up again when Mark's temper puts Gabe in danger whilst with Paige and Jack.

On 19 March 2018, it was confirmed that Morley would be leaving "Neighbours" alongside Valance. After seeing how much Mark is struggling with their relationship, Paige and Jack decide to leave Erinsborough for a fresh start in Queensland with their son.

Shortly after arriving at the Lassiter's Complex, John bumps into Paige Smith. They run into each other again outside the hotel, just as the boiler room explodes. John throws himself on top of Paige to protect her. He is taken to the hospital, where he remains in a coma. One of the nurses tells Paige that they do not know who he is, as he had no identification on him. Paige stays by his bedside and is present when he wakes up. John suffers from amnesia and cannot remember his own name. Paige gets him a job with Amy Williams's handywoman business. Amy also offers him a place to live. John meets with a hotel employee, who spoke to him on the day of the explosion, but she cannot help him find out who he is. Paige puts up flyers, asking if anyone can identify John. A hotel guest named Steven Aniston (Garikai Jani) recalls John saying he has links with Geelong. John and Paige travel to the city and stay in a local hostel. Just as Paige and John are about to kiss, Paige spots a photograph of John with another man, who they later learn is Dustin Oliver (Kevin Clayette). They arrange to meet Dustin in Erinsborough. He greets John as "Jay", before he runs away when he spots Mark Brennan in his police uniform. John decides to leave town, but Paige persuades him to stay. John has two hypnosis sessions with Karl Kennedy, who later refers him to a psychiatrist.

Mandy Franze claims to be John's girlfriend, but they soon find out she is lying. Paige tries to kiss John, but he rejects her and Paige asks him to leave. John sees a woman driving a van and says he remembers her and the company, which he later learns repairs boilers. John suffers flashbacks of the Lassiter's boiler room and believes that he may have caused the explosion. He then goes to the police to confess, but the detective tells him that he did not cause the explosion. John kisses Paige. The witness who saw him on the morning of the explosion later reveals she was paid to lie. John's memory returns and he is able to tell Mark that Julie Quill (Gail Easdale) and Jacka Hills (Brad McMurray) caused the explosion. Paige comes to the station and John emerges in clerical clothing. He reveals his name is Jack Callahan and that he is a priest. He explains that he was questioning his faith when he came to Erinsborough and was staying with a priest in Elliot Park, but when he went away to Rome, Jack was left to counsel Julie at the church. He followed her to Lassiter's and saw her in the boiler room, but did not expect her to cause an explosion. Jack briefly leaves Erinsborough to see his family and Paige says she will wait for him. Jack faces conflicting pressures between his love for Paige and his vow of celibacy. Jack looks after a little girl named Poppy Jarvis, who has cystic fibrosis, whilst her mother is in hospital, and he oganises an fancy dress party for her. Ari Philcox reveals in the confessional that he's been releasing the snakes. Jack's priestly vows forbid him passing on this information. Jack thinks that Paige is the intended target, but later learns that Steph is.

Jack receives an audio message from Paige's sister, Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) of Paige declaring her love to him while on a hot air balloon trip, but during the voice message, Jack learns that Paige and her family are in danger and drives to the crash site. Jack sees everyone except for Paige, and Piper tells him that Paige jumped off the balloon before it crashed. Jack goes to find her and finds her red scarf in a dam. After searching, he finds an unconscious Paige on the shore, who suffers from hypothermia. He carries her to an abandoned shack to warm her up. Jack told Paige that he knows how sorry she is and confess his love to Paige. The pair then sleep together, reconciling their relationship. They are soon found by Paige's father, Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin). Jack leaves for Queensland, later returning with his former girlfriend, Simone Bader, causing Paige to again feel betrayed. Jack and Paige break up as he chooses the church over her again. Jack becomes jealous over Paige's friendship with David Tanaka (Takaya Honda). Jack finds out that Paige is pregnant and Jack assumes he's the father, but Paige says that he's not and that David is the father. Jack wants Dustin Oliver to help with a new refugee centre, but Dustin refuses thinking, wrongly, that he may be the father of Paige's baby, and wants to get away. When Jack learns that he is the father of Paige's baby, he considers leaving the priesthood and remaining in Erinsborough with Paige, whose parents are leaving for the Gold Coast. Paige considers leaving with them, but decides to stay, so Jack can be with his child. Paige returns to the shack where their child was conceived and goes into labour. Jack and Karl find her and help deliver her son. Paige loses consciousness and is rushed to the hospital, while the baby is taken to a neonatal unit. Jack decides to leave the church. Lauren returns to support Paige, and is initially angry with Jack for letting Paige go off on her own. Paige eventually regains consciousness and names their son Gabriel. After learning Paige's sister is ill, Jack encourages Paige to go to Queensland with Lauren to support her. Having decided to give up his position within the church, Jack calls Bishop Green (Mirko Grillini). Bishop Green tells Jack that if he quits the priesthood the church will close. He decides to go through with his plan and leaves the church. He moves into Erinsborough Backpackers. Jack declares his feelings for Paige, but she rejects him. Jack works with Stephanie Scully on an application for the Most Liveable Suburb competition and they kiss. Steph initially calls it a mistake, but they later have sex and soon begin a relationship. Jack supports Steph when she thinks she is having a mental health relapse, and when she turns her motel into a cancer wellness centre. Jack secures a job at Erinsborough High as a counsellor, but some students accuse him of promoting religion.

Near to his first appearance while his identity remained unknown, sources weren't sure what to make of John, with Kilkelly ("Digital Spy") describing him as "mysterious" and Sam Warner ("Digital Spy") commenting, "it's unclear if he is a hero or villain". Dainty ("Digital Spy") felt that the character of Jack caused big changes to Paige's life, describing him as "the priest who turned Paige Smith's life upside down".

Katie Baillie from the "Metro" called Jack a "poor lad" after Paige doesn't tell him about the baby. She later showed him compassion when Paige told him her baby was his, commenting, "In fairness, it is pretty bad news for the guy, given that he's in the priesthood and shouldn't be making babies. But hearing it from Paige as she thinks she's about to die and learning other people knew this whole time isn't ideal for him either." However, she later lets on that Jack may have a bit of a childish side after getting into a fight with Mark over Paige, commenting, "Jack can't act like an adult about it all." Fans disliked the pairing of Jack and Steph, labelling the paring "disgusting", "dumb" and "random". When Steph fails to priortise her relationship with Jack, fans expressed their disapproval of the relationship again, commenting, "I don't like Jack and Steph at all. Time to split!"

Kana ligature

In the Japanese writing system are typographic ligatures in the kana writing system, both hiragana and katakana. These are now obsolete, and almost none are represented in standard character encodings. The only widely available ones are the hiragana and the katakana . They are also known as and .

These characters were widely used until a spelling reform of 1900 decreed that each sound (mora) would be represented by one (kana) character. They were not represented in computer character encodings until JIS X 0213:2000 (JIS2000) added "yori" and "koto".

In the 21st century, in modern Internet slang, some ligatures are made using existing characters, such as 托 for キモ in 托い for (托い is not a word, but it would be pronounced "taku-i", and mean "entrust-"adjective"") and ル for ノレ in モルール for (モルール would be pronounced "morūru").

Women in Law &amp; Development in Africa

Women in Law & Development in Africa (WiLDAF) is a Pan-African women's rights organization and network which is non-profit and non-government (NGO) and contains 500 organizations, 1200 individuals and spreads over 27 countries. Even though WiLDAF functions as a multi-regional/transnational organization, it pays close attention to the economical, social and historical differences between states and countries.

This organization grew out of the "women's rights as human rights" movement, as a more assertive claim to rights for women than the previous rhetoric of "needs". 

WiLDAF centers around the principle that equality and empowerment are essential to a healthy society, and they focus their efforts on development and the law in relation to women to advocate for and educate people. They believe that empowering women through education, workshops, communication and outreach around development and law is extremely valuable. In addition, they work at national and regional levels to spur institutional planning, development and building international connections for added support. The organization also provides aid in the case of a violation of women's rights by providing Emergency Response Systems and facilitating centers for women who have been abused psychologically, physically or morally (and in such cases can shelter the woman and help her to take legal action) 

Women in Law & Development in Africa was established in February 1990 during a regional conference in Harare, Zimbabwe (with the theme of "Women, right and development: network for empowerment in Africa") as a result of 6 women coming together with the idea for a pan-African organization after attending the World Women's Conference held in Nairobi, 1985. This forum was also instrumental in the creation of WiLDAF because issues around women's rights became the topic of debate for the many African women participating in the forum.

The World Women's Conference was where the ideas around "women's rights as human rights" became a topic of debate.

Another notable point in the origin of WiLDAF was where humanitarian organizations lobbied for the formal recognition of woman's rights during the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna 1993. 

An additional conference that furthered the "women's rights as human rights" movement was the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in Beijing in 1995, where this movement was further defined. As well as providing a topic of debate around women's rights as human rights, the conference also spurred debate about empowerment through law.

The three aforementioned meetings were sponsered by the "Women in Law and Development" project by a US donor agency called OEF International.
OEF International facilitated the growth of regional networks of organizations to combine their efforts and work at local levels to spread education and information around women's rights issues. In addition to WiLDAF, OEF International supported the formation of Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development (APWLD) as well as the Comité de América Latina y El Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer (CLADEM) in Latin America and the Caribbean.

WiLDAF's head office is located in Harare, Zimbabwe. As a transnational organization, WiLDAF contains national offices as well as local offices in specific regions; in certain regions local WiLDAF Advisory Committees and representatives function in-stead of local offices where there are none. WiLDAF's meetings, agendas and decision-making are built on a "from the ground-up" philosophy around structure which begins at the local level and continues through to larger and larger structures including country, regional and international. Member individuals and organizations are involved at many steps of decision-making and meetings. Surveys and reports are often part of meetings (see below "Surveys").
WiLDAF hold their General Assembly every few years to plan and prioritize for the future, reaffirm and add to their objectives as well as celebrate accomplishments.

WiLDAF grew out of the movement called "women's rights as human rights", which emphasizes that rights can be lobbied for, enforced and monitored as opposed to the language of "needs". It also moves away from manifestos and demands present in earlier feminist discourse. Furthermore, Human rights does not take the standard as the rights of "men", therefore organizations can better address the reproductive, maternity, gender-based discrimination and domestic violence needs that women require. This movement advocated for women's rights in all spheres, including promoting private affairs to be under lawful scrutiny (such as domestic violence) in regions which traditionally separate the private and public domains and as a result call to reform "family law". A distinction between the "private" and the "public" is made here as "private" laws tend to affect women in particular due to the fact that women tend to be relegated there by societal expectations. The private is also traditionally (whether culturally, regionally or religiously) the place where the state does not extend, and therefore provides multi-layered hurdles for advocacy actions. "Women's rights as human rights" is a movement to claim the rights women have and to empower women through education and an interconnectivity of local and global spheres. 
An aspect of the "woman's rights as human rights" movement that remains in the aims of WiLDAF is an inter-connectivity between both local and global efforts to empower women through law and development as discussed below. Communication between all facets of WiLDAF as well as local through to international communication is a main aim of the organization as they believe that transparent communication allows umbrella organizations and WiLDAF members to learn from one an others experiences. 

Under their Development aims, WiLDAF facilitates women to seek knowledge and empowerment through increased and established access to resources (such as economic, health, societal). This is done through a number of events notably training and workshops discussed below. Inter-connectivity is always underscored.

WiLDAF's main aims under law are to provide education for women about the law, how to use law, to facilitate their participation in it, and encourage workshops to create communities of empowered women that have the skills and confidence to use their lawful rights. The aims around protecting and promoting women's legal rights revolve around instances and events at which time laws should be upheld to protect women's safety and health, notably around issues with violence against women, sexual harassment, property rights, marriage and inheritance. There are many things that constitute violence against women including physical violence, rape, dowry deaths, genital mutilation or sexual slavery among many other acts.

Further discrimination more broadly defined includes a women's economic, social, and political position in regards to her standing in society as affected by institution, her marital or dependent status (children), as well as her accessibility to education, healthcare and reproductive rights. For example, one form of traditional discrimination against widows states that widows are to be locked up for 6 months after their husbands pass away and are often banned from many normal life activities such as making money. In these circumstances, the women usually end up living in poverty and loneliness with no support offered to them. Psychological discrimination such as widowhood practices often subordinates subjects and creates an environment that allows for the discrimination of those individuals in other ways as well. Here too does the conversation of private/public pertain in regards to the private domain oppressing the woman through an immunity of law. Psychological, cultural, economic, social and physical discrimination and violence are therefore interrelated because of a woman's vulnerable positioning in society, economy and politics. Laws are often not upheld in certain regions due to long histories of women suppression and a lack of education and available resources. 

WiLDAF has a number of projects and efforts it employs in accordance with their aims (some of which are briefly introduced above). 

Advocacy is an important facet of WiLDAF, as they often facilitate sensitization, workshops, debate meetings and also lobbying for changes in law in order to speak about violence towards women, female genital mutilation, sexual harassment, forced or underage marriages, HIV/AIDS education and the treatment of widows. WiLDAF uses many strategies to advocate their cause, including those above as well as the internet, news bulletins (WiLDAF News), publication, national surveys, medical services, aid, emergency response systems, and partnerships with other organizations in specific regions for localized needs. In addition, WiLDAF has been at the forefront of thinking about and integrating services for disabled women in Africa with a policy of mainstreaming disabilities for increased acceptance, tolerance and services.

WiLDAF created and distributed media campaigns to spread the awareness about women's rights in addition to their training sessions. Under their media campaigns, they also have information against domestic violence to empower women to claim their rights, seek legal actions and not stay silent against their oppressors. 

One way in which WiLDAF maintains the international eye on women's rights in Africa is by publishing reports, or "country reports", on regions about various topics including common and customary law. They include anecdotal evidence from women survivors of violence, try to express the current standing of laws, express observations made in the region. This has also led to a study by WiLDAF into governmental accountability, and to explore the theories of government accountability used by the international human rights movement, established during the conference in Beijing. 

Many African states today differ in their law make-up, and numerous operate in tiered manners including state-laws, customary and religious laws in regions of significant Muslim population. One of the ways in which WiLDAF uses these reports is to highlight areas of customary/religious laws which oppress women, and urge states to challenge these laws in light of international human rights agreements. These reports can take the form of shadow reports to highlight and support governmental reports in order to provide more information or show areas which the governmental reports may have not reported; they may also keep track of how legal reforms and laws have been integrated and enforced in specific regions. They publish these reports widely and internationally which invites the international eye in respect to regional goals around human rights and women participation in law, urging regions to improve their human rights laws.

WiLDAF's Emergency Response System was organized in an effort to provide immediate relief and support in the event of serious human rights violations against women in the countries they represent. It is to be called upon when those countries and its citizens feel powerless to the situation or require international support; such situations could be proposals for laws that go against human rights, infringement of goals set by states to offer women more resources or opportunities or direct violence on women. On average the Emergency Response System is used once a year.
This program is in support of WiLDAF's aim to offer aid and advocacy in areas of conflict and conflict situations.

Lobbying is an important role of WiLDAF which has been improved and strengthened by international treaties, one of which notably is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), passed in 1980. CEDAW in particular views rights, as WiLDAF does, through a gendered outlook by expanding rights for women rather than just granting those that men have. Through these treaties and their provision of legal mechanisms, organizations such as WiLDAF and women themselves are able to lobby for the implementation and revision of laws, as well as report response to CEDAW, by pressuring local governments. Lobbying takes place at the government of a specific region to reform current laws. Lobbying for rights has been made difficult by the Structural Adjustment Programs (SAP's) due to the programs governmental restructuring and opening to international corporations; this has caused a lack of faith in citizens of some regions on account of the state leaving basic services to be taken care of by other means.

16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence is an event is adopted by WiLDAF as a series of 16 days between International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women on November 25th and International Human Rights Day on December 10th. The annual project features many events such as projects, campaigns, or workshops that each region can plan independently with respect to their local needs. The activities are geared towards education and promotion of awareness through the regional inter-connectivity of these events.

Since 2007, Women in Law and Development in Africa - Ghana division - has been partnering with Crossroads International to educate and bring awareness surrounding the law and justice system to men and women. In addition to this, they provide support for women who have endured violence with their "Access to Justice Program".

Amyton, South Australia

Amyton is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the eastern side of the Flinders Ranges about north of the state capital of Adelaide and about north-east of the municipal seat of Melrose.

Boundaries for the locality were created on 13 March 1997 and was given the “long established name” of Amyton which is derived from the former Government Town of Amyton.

The government town was intended to be the principal settlement of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Pinda. It was surveyed in January 1879 and laid out as “204 house allotments and 180 larger blocks and parklands.” It was proclaimed on 10 April 1879 and was named after the eldest daughter of William Jervois, the Governor of South Australia. It was diminished on 13 May 1954 by the cancellation of the loan registration book for the land intended for “school purposes” and resumption of all of the land intended for the school, parklands and the town, and was proclaimed to ‘cease to exist’ on 13 June 1957.

The town had as many as “four buildings and many temporary constructions” at one time and had a school in operation from 1881 to 1930. As of 2012, “nothing remains but a small pioneer cemetery” and “a few rubble heaps…” Geoffrey Manning, the South Australian historian, notes that the town was not successful because the “uncertainty of the rainfall” made the growing of wheat unviable, although farmers of the time could practise dairying as the “good variety of summer fodders, such as saltbush and blue bush” realized better financial returns than growing wheat.

Amyton is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the local government area of the District Council of Mount Remarkable.

Convenience Store Woman

Keiko Furukura had always been considered a strange child, and her parents always worried how she would get on in the real world, so when she takes on a job in a convenience store while at university, they are delighted for her. For her part, in the convenience store she finds a predictable world mandated by the store manual, which dictates how the workers should act and what they should say, and she copies her coworkers' style of dress and speech patterns so that she can play the part of a normal person. However, eighteen years later, at age 36, she is still in the same job, has never had a boyfriend, and has only few friends. She feels comfortable in her life, but is aware that she is not living up to society's expectations and causing her family to worry about her. When a similarly alienated but cynical and bitter young man comes to work in the store, he will upset Keiko's contented stasis--but will it be for the better?

The AX50 is a sniper rifle developed by British firearms manufacturer Accuracy International. Devised as an upgrade, it is the latest iteration of the AW50 rifle and is built to withstand sustained, heavy usage. Inheriting all the attributes of its predecessor, it allows the operator a high level of accuracy and performance in the harshest of conditions.

The AX50 is a variant of the AX series of sniper rifles that entered production in 2010. Fabricated by Accuracy International to meet the modern demands of military and police units alike and was designed with long range precision accuracy in mind for a more accurate anti-materiel weapon. According to Accuracy International the development of the series was partly influenced by the Precision Sniper Rifle (PSR) U.S. Special Operations Command solicitation.

The AX50 is a bolt-action, .50 BMG sniper/anti-materiel rifle weighing 26 1bs., and is 54 inches in overall length with a 27-inch free floated barrel that can be changed in less than 10 minutes. The AX50 comes with an integrated 0 MOA rail as well as featuring a "Firing pin cocking indicator" saftey allowing the user to ascertain wether the rifle is chambered. Contributing to its high degree of accuracy is its billet steel receiver. The rifle itself is built on an aluminum chassis, and has a retractable stock which can be folded to the left to shorten the overall length of the rifle when needed, and features a two-stage trigger with a 3.3 to 4.4 1bs. adjustible pull. Like all other Accuracy International rifles, it is generally fitted with a Schmidt & Bender PM II telescopic sight.

The AX sniper rifle series comes in four different variants which were designed for long, high-powered super magnum cartridges.

The series comprises the AXMC, a multi calibre rifle that can be chambered either in .338 Lapua Magnum or 300 Winchester Magnum, when it is reconfigured by changing the bolt, magazine/insert, and barrel. As well as the non-multi calibre AX308 chambered in 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester and the AX50 Anti-materiel rifle chambered in .50 BMG.

<doc id="56574447" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56574447" title="Nicola Mazza">
Nicola Mazza

Nicola Mazza (10 March 1790 – 2 August 1865) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest. Mazza was born in and served as a priest in Verona and was dedicated to both the evangelization of Central Africa (he used to be called "Don Congo" due to this) and equal access to a good education. He served as a teacher for over three decades as well as a chaplain and was known for his dedication to the Christian formation of children. Mazza was also a student and close friend to Saint Gaspare Bertoni and was also close with a range of prominent prelates including Saint Daniele Comboni whom he sent to the missions in Africa.

Mazza's beatification process opened in the 1920s and culminated on 3 June 2013 after Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue and named Mazza as Venerable.

Nicola Mazza was born on 10 March 1790 in Verona as the eldest of nine brothers to the silk and fabric merchants Luigi Mazza and Rosa Pajola. His parents managed a fabric store in the Piazza delle Erbe. The Mazza's moved to Marcellise in 1797 following the French occupation; the town was a hamlet of San Martino Buon Albergo. In 1821 his father was forced to sell his estate and villa due to financial difficulties.

He was a student to the priest Antonio Cesari and was also a close disciple to Saint Gaspare Bertoni who both proved to be strong influences on Mazza's life and personal spiritual inclinations. Cesari was brought in to homeschool Mazza since the latter's often frail health prevented him from going to school. His vocation matured under Cesari's guidance and he soon felt called to enter the priesthood as a more direct means to dedicate himself to the needs of the poor. He commenced his ecclesial studies in Verona on 21 June 1807 before Mazza received his ordination to the priesthood on 26 March 1814. Following his ordination he first served in the churches of S. Fermo Maggiore and San Nicolò before being assigned in 1816 to teach seminarians in Verona. For over three decades from 1816 until 1849 he taught students in Verona both mathematics (from 1815 to 1816) and, occasionally, physics and world history. The students held him in high regard as did fellow teachers while some of his students included the Venerable Antonio Provolo and Blessed Zefirino Agostini. It was also around this time that he became a confessor and close friend to the Venerable Teresa Campostrini. His professorship solidified his desire to create a range of opportunities for people to have a fairer and better access to education irrespective of their class or economic status. His companions around this point following his ordination - students and confreres alike - knew of Mazza's desire to evangelize Africa and referred to him as "Don Congo".

On 14 September 1838 the Emperor Ferdinand I awarded him a large golden medal with a necklace in tribute to Mazza's work in the field of culture and education.

Mazza sent six missionaries in 1857 to Central Africa with the hope of evangelizing the region which had been a lifelong ambition for him despite the fact that he never set foot on the African continent. He blessed the new missionaries which included Saint Daniele Comboni and Giovanni Beltrame who became prominent figures in the missions there. Mazza had also sent Francesco Oliboni and Angelo Melotto as well as Alessandro dal Bosco while also sending Isidoro Zilli who was neither a priest nor religious but a catechist. Mazza held the view that the African people alone could be successful in evangelizing since their efforts would be much more successful among their own people as opposed to foreigners.

His health began to decline in July 1865 and he died the following month. The local papers "Eco de Veneto" and "Nuova Gazzetta di Verona" followed the news of Mazza's declining health from the outset until Mazza's death a month later after news broke of his failing health. Mazza's remains are interred in the church of San Carlo Borromeo.

Mazza's beatification process opened in 1925 in an investigation that had been launched in Verona and had closed in 1927 while a second process opened in that diocese in 1934 and was later closed in 1937. The third and final investigation into Mazza's life and works was launched several decades later in 1988 and closed not long after in 1989. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the investigation in Rome on 14 December 1990 and later received the Positio dossier from the postulation in two parts in 2000 and 2003 for assessment. It was in between that period that the historical consultants to the C.C.S. approved the cause on 1 October 2002 based on the part of the Positio that had been submitted in 2002. Theologians advising the C.C.S. likewise confirmed the cause a decade later on 21 February 2012 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members on 21 May 2013.

Mazza was declared to be Venerable on 3 June 2013 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest had lived a life of heroic virtue.

The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Francesco Massagrande.

St Mary's Church, Whitchurch

St Mary's Church, Whitchurch is a listed Anglican place of worship in the suburb of Whitchurch, Cardiff. 

A church in the locality is first recorded in the twelfth century, though the date of its founding and its dedication are now unknown. At this time, Whitchurch was a chapel of ease to Llandaff Cathedral, and would remain so until the 19th Century. The first church which is known to have carried the dedication to Mary was first erected in the 14th Century. In the 15th or 16th Century, a porch was added, followed later still by a nave, then a belfry of Bath stone. The graveyard dated from 1616, when a licence for baptisms, marriages and burials was obtained. Later alterations to the interior were carried out in 1810. The old church could seat 300. Despite the fact that it was growing too small for the growing population (which the new Melingriffith Tin Plate Works had bolstered to 696), the issue of the church's inadequate facilities would not be addressed for several decades. During the 19th Century, Whitchurch also acquired its first Nonconformist places of worship, with the Whitchurch Methodist Church being founded in .

As Whitchurch gradually evolved into a suburb over the 19th Century, the population of the district continued to expand. Whitchurch became a separate parish in 1845. The Revd. J.T. Clarke, who became the vicar of St Mary's in 1876, was dissatisfied by the inadequate (and increasingly rundown) church, and began to agitate for a replacement. The new church was finally provided in 1884, located around 300 metres to the north-east from its predecessor. It was designed by John Prichard, and was consecrated for worship in 1885. After its replacement came into use, the old church was largely abandoned and lapsed into decay. It was ruinous by the turn of the 20th Century and was demolished in 1904. Its graveyard remained until being converted into a public garden, St Mary's Gardens, in 1973, which is still extant on Old Church Road. The church became Listed in 1975.

The church is now in the Rectorial Benefice of Whitchurch. It has three daughter churches: All Saints (Rhiwbina), All Saints (Llandaff North) and St Thomas's (Birchgrove).

Blackstone Legal Fellowship

The Blackstone Legal Fellowship is an American legal training and internship program developed and facilitated by Christian legal group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). Since its inception in 2000, more than 1,900 law students have participated in the program. Its main campus is in Scottsdale, Arizona. Notable faculty have included U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Amy Coney Barrett. 

Blackstone Legal Fellowship is a highly competitive, nine week intensive summer legal training program which spans June though August. It was founded in 2000 for the purpose of preparing Christian law students for professional legal careers. The first class comprised 24 interns. Since its inception Blackstone has trained more than 1,900 Christian law students. In an interview, ADF co-founder Alan Sears said in 2000 Blackstone was created in response to his observation, "There’s got to be a better way for law students in America and for young lawyers than we currently have." The program is made up of interns, called Fellows, from a diverse selection of law schools as well as elite institutions such as Harvard and Yale.The program is named for Sir William Blackstone, the famed eighteenth century English legal scholar and jurist whose influential commentaries on the common law had a profound impact on the Founding Fathers of the United States.
In 2012, Sears was asked about the major achievements of ADF. He said "among the things I am most thankful for are our Blackstone Legal Fellowship graduates."

In 2017, President Donald Trump's nominee to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Amy Coney Barrett, was criticized by Senator Al Franken for teaching constitutional law at Blackstone. In her Senate committee hearing he referred to ADF as a "hate group". Barrett responded that the hate group label is "controversial". Barrett was confirmed to the court by the full Senate.

The Blackstone Fellowship consists of three phases described as Learn, Lead, and Defend. Fellows spend the first two weeks of the program in the classroom studying under an impressive faculty in areas such as ethics, theology and jurisprudence. Sessions consist of lectures as well as hands-on interactive presentations. 

The second phase of the program focuses on six-week field placements at a variety of venues across the United States and abroad including "public-interest law firms, attorneys, law professors, think tanks, and public-policy organizations." Placements are carefully selected based on students' aptitude and career goals. 

Finally, the Fellows return to ADF in Scottsdale for a week long series of presentations focusing on career development and professional networking. Speakers include legal academics, members of the judiciary, elected representatives, and practicing attorneys. Interns are given an orientation to the Blackstone alumni network.

The cost of attendance at Blackstone is $6,300. Most Blackstone Fellows receive a scholarship to attend the program. In addition, stipends are available to cover expenses during the placement phase of the program.

The following is a list of people who are currently or have been affiliated with Blackstone.

Flag of Sutherland

The Sutherland flag is the flag of the Scottish county of Sutherland. It was registered with the Flag Institute as the flag of the county in 2018. The flag was announced in the Northern Times newspaper in January 2018 following a competition to devise a county flag, established by the local community in conjunction with the Flag Institute. It was added to the Flag Institute registry on 26 January 2018. The county's Lord Lieutenancy froze the flag's registration with the Court of the Lord Lyon in March 2018 in light of opposition to the flag's design and the nature of the competition. 

The design features a swooping eagle, seen face on, against a vertical bicoloured red and yellow background, with the eagle counterchanged yellow and red. The bicolour of red and yellow represents the Atlantic Ocean and North Sea, which border the county on its west and east coasts respectively. At the hoist are three stars or mullets. These, plus the red and yellow colour combination, are taken from the arms borne by Hugh de Moray, Earl of Sutherland.

After the highland newspaper, "The Northern Times", published the final design, some Sutherland residents expressed disapproval, mainly through social media. Complaints focused on the colours, said to evoke communism, and that the eagle was crudely drawn and not the best choice to represent the region. It was suggested that the Scottish wildcat, a symbol of associated with Sutherland, would have made a more appropriate choice. A spokesman for the flag selection committee countered that the "eagle featured prominently on a considerable number of the entries", that the wildcat is more associated with Caithness, and an eagle is more unifying as being prominent across the county.

The Court of the Lord Lyon started of the process of formally recognising the flag in early February 2018. A petition was put forth by one Sutherland resident to redesign the flag. The Vice Lord Lieutenant of Sutherland and chairman of the Flag Selection Committee asserted though that feedback, outside of social media, and especially from schools and young people from across Sutherland continues to indicate very strong support for the design. Due to the opposition towards the design, the office of the Lord Lyon halted the process of registering the flag, stating: "I understand that the petitioners (the Lord Lieutenancy) are considering the matter and, until we hear from them, no further procedures will take place in our office."

CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures

The CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) were published in 2012 by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems of the Bank for International Settlements and the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions.

It sets out twenty-four principles to be followed to manage market risk in financial market infrastructure.

In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England acts as regulator for payment systems, central securities depositories and central counterparties. For these regulated organisations, the bank requires the operator complies with the CPSS-IOSCO principles.

The operations of the system must have a clear basis in the law of the jurisdictions it operates in. This is important to avoid the uncertainty that would result if there was the possibility that the courts might void or hold-up transactions.

Market governance arrangements must be clear and transparent. They should support the stablity of the market and take account of the wider public interest.

The market operator must have a proper risk management framework.

The market operator must carefully manage its credit exposure to market participants, and have sufficient resources to cover any credit risk it is exposed to.

If the market requires collateral, it must chose collateral with low credit, liquidity and market risks.

Central counterparties must manage their credit exposure to market participants by ensuring they have an effective margin system.

The market operator must monitor and manage liquidity risk.

Liabilities incurred must be settled with finality, at the very least at the end of the day where value is credited, but ideally in real-time.

The system should settle in central bank money wherever possible. Credit risk and liquidity risk must be minimised.

If the market deals with securities or commodities, there must be clear rules about their physical delivery.

Risks relating to the storage and delivery of physical securities and commodities must be managed.

Where a securities depository holds the underlying securities of a market it must manage this 'safeguarding' risk, and ensure the securities are held separately from its own assets.

Where two linked obligations are exchanged in a transaction (for example, foreign exchange), the settlement of one must be conditional on the settlement of the other.

The market needs to have rules to cope with the default of a market participant, ensuring the losses are contained and liquidity preserved to allow the market to continue to operate.

For a central counterparty, it must be possible to segregate and move the positions of the participants' customers.

The market operator must manage its own business risks to ensure it can continue as a going concern. It must maintain a reserve to ensure it can be wound down in an orderly fashion if the need arises.

Assets, whether belonging to the market operator or market participants, must be safeguarded against losses. Any investments must be chosen for minimal credit, liquidity and market risks.

A financial market must identify operational risks: both internally and across the market and its participants. Where appropriate, they should mitigate the risks through controls.

Systems used by the market must have a high degree of reliability and security, and must have sufficient capacity for the needs of the market.

Business continuity must be in place to recover from disruption.

Criteria for participating in the market must be objective and transparent, ensuring fair and open access.

Where the financial market has participants at different tiers (i.e. direct participants, and indirect participants who are themselves serviced by the direct participants) then the market operator needs to monitor and manage the risks that such indirect relationships could cause.

If a financial market infrastructure (FMI) is interlinked to another FMI then it needs to monitor and manage the risks relating to that relationship.

Financial markets should be structured to efficiently and effectively meet the needs they were created to serve.

The market should use relevant and internationally accepted methods of communicating transactions.

The rules and procedures of the financial market must be clear. Participants must have sufficient information to enable them to understand the risks that they take by participating in the market, and the costs of doing so.

Rules and key procedures must be disclosed publicly.

A trade repository must disclose relevant market information to the public and government authorities that is timely and accurate.

Halmon is around to the northeast in Andaç and Gérāmon to the northwest, just right next to Halmon. Assyrian inhabitants of these proximate villages have ever since intermixed.

Rather close to the border of Northern Iraq and within the upper reaches of Mesopotamia, the village is situated in a precipitous highland on a valley and is surrounded by mountains. The area's vegetation is Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub. Summers are hot and dry with temperatures around 33 °C and winters are cold and wet, hovering around 4 °C. Snowfall is common in the cool months.

The economy of the village is based on livestock and beekeeping.

Albert Saléza

Albert Saléza (18 October 1867 – 26 November 1916) was a French tenor.

Born in Bruges, last child of a large family of 12 children, and, as an orphan from the age of 8 years old, Saléza was sent to a Girondine property of senator where he became an assistant shepherd. But the country sickness forced him to return to his native commune where he became a sandal worker. Difficulty feeding led him to accept a job as a gravel digger on the Pau-Laruns railway, then as a sandaler in Bayonne, where wages were higher.

At his places of work, his voice was noticed by two Basque music lovers, who introduced him to the director of the music school, Mr. Jubin, and then to his first teacher, Gaston Salzedo. With this one, Saléza, who had hitherto received only a basic education, made rapid progress in all fields: instruction, diction, singing, music... so much so that he won the First prize of the school in 1886, which allowed him to integrate the Conservatoire de Paris where he won again the first prize in singing and the second prize in opera before a jury composed notably of Léo Delibes and Ambroise Thomas.

On leaving the conservatory, because of his fragile health, he chose the Opéra-Comique instead of the Opera which would have been too demanding so quickly. From his first role, Mylio in "Le roi d'Ys", his performance aroused the enthusiasm of the audience at the Salle Favart. From the Opéra-Comique, Albert Saléza moved on to the Opéra de Nice where he recovered his strength. He gained further notoriety by interpreting "Faust", "Roméo et Juliette", "Carmen", "Richard III"...

In 1892, Ernest Reyer noticed him and offered him the consecration by giving him a role tailored to his needs at the Paris Opera: Matho in "Salammbô". The triumph he obtained allowed him to repeat success after success: "Le Cid", "Die Walküre", "la Damnation de Faust" His fame was so great that Verdi offered him the role of "Otello" that he performeded 35 times until May 1895.

Unfortunately, health problems hit his vocal chords and forced him to stop for 2 years. In 1897, Saléza returned to the Opéra de Paris, then, in Monte Carlo, Brussels and Covent Garden of London where he sang in particular in "Carmen" with Emma Calvé, and "Roméo et Juliette" with Nellie Melba, and very often in front of the future king Edward VII. He reached the pinnacle of his glory in Chicago and the Metropolitan of New York, thanks to his interpretations in "Faust", "Lucia di Lammermoor", "Les Huguenots"…

In 1912, after all these successes abroad, he returned to France and was appointed professor of lyric declamation at the Conservatoire where his results turned out to be excellent with students who won all the first prizes. But on 26 November 1916, this new career came to a sudden halt when he collapsed during a mass in the .

Saléza married in 1895 to Pauline Bonnecarrère (1875–1953) and had three children: Mylio (1896–1957), Madeleine (1899–1913), and José (1905–?). He died on 26 November 1916 in the 17th arrondissement of Paris.

An Albert Saléza fund was created from 21 handwritten notebooks relating the career of the French tenor, excerpts from press articles and photographs, all from the collection of Mylio Saléza (for photographs) and his wife Marie-Louise, who kept the memory of her father-in-law until her death in 1995.

Strabops

Strabops is a genus of strabopid found in Missouri, United States. Initially it was described as a genus of primitive eurypterid, but now is considered to be classified within its own order, the Strabopida. It contains one species, "S. thacheri". 
Has been discussed whether "Paleomerus" is a synonym for "Strabops" or not, since the only difference that separates these genera is the position of the eye and telson's length.

"Strabops thacheri" is closely related to "Paleomerus hamiltoni", with which it shares a short carapace, eleven abdominal segments and a broad conical telson. Appendages of strabopids are unknown, but because of the short length of their carapace, Bergström suggested in 1971 that they probably had fewer than seven pairs of prosomal appendages, although the present authors think that even this may be an overestimate. The trunk tergites are straight abaxially, besides that "Strabops" has dorsal eyes.

WSC Real 11: World Snooker Championship

WSC Real 11: World Snooker Championship (Or, WSC Real 11) is a sport simulation video game, released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on Apr 15, 2011, and PC on April 1, 2011. The game was the tenth (and final) entry of the World Snooker Championship video games series. The game featured player likenesses from the real world, including Shaun Murphy, Mark Selby and Ronnie O'Sullivan.

The game was developed and published by Dark Energy Digital with licensing from the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. The game would be the last console game fully licensed by World Snooker, however, they would continue to make handheld games, on iOS and Android.

Many features from previous games remain, with the traditional career mode allowing players to play as a rookie, and win matches on the official Snooker or Pool tours to improve their world ranking, and qualify for more prestigious tournaments, such as the Masters, the UK Open, or the Snooker World Championships. New to 2011, a rewind game assist, allowing certain shots (once missed), to be replayed.

The player character's appearance can be modified and altered, and experience points from the main game can be used to update the player's character look and skills. The player can play both the official Snooker tour and an amalgamated Eight-Ball pool season simultaneously.

The game received average reviews by critics. Video game aggregate website GameRankings stated that reviewers were largely impressed by the games, scoring the PlayStation 3 version at 64%, and the xBox 360 version at 65%. GameSpot reviewed both of these versions, scoring the game at 7.5/10, calling it an "enjoyable experience, with realistic cue and ball physics and a wide selection of features and game modes." They also cited the game's new rewind system, and the game's improved graphics over past iterations.

Tom Orry from Video Gamer magazine scored the game at 6/10, saying "I'm a big snooker fan so I could play WSC Real 11 for hours, putting up with its problems, but that doesn't mean it's a good virtual version of the sport." Orry commented on the games difficulty, stating that the game's assists either made the game "far too easy or far too difficult." before commenting that "WSC Real 11 is passable, but it's a long way from being an easy recommendation."

Ted Corbett (chemist)

Robert Edward Corbett (13 June 1923 – 3 February 2018) was a New Zealand organic chemist. He is noted for his contribution to natural product chemistry through the isolation and structural elucidation of compounds from New Zealand native plants.

Born on 13 June 1923, Corbett was the son of Walter Corbett and Margaret Whitehead Corbett (née Robertson). He studied at the University of Otago, graduating Master of Science with first-class honours in chemistry in 1945. Corbett later undertook doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge under Alexander Todd on the structures of some of the metabolites—puberulic acid, puberulonic acid, and stipitatic acid—of "Penicillium" species. He showed that they contain the tropolone skeleton, and his PhD thesis, titled "The structure of certain antibiotics" was completed in 1950.

In 1949, Corbett married Enid Mary Carter in Cambridge, England, and they went on to have two children.

In 1945, Corbett was appointed as a lecturer in chemistry at Otago. After returning from Cambridge in 1950, Corbett rose to became a professor in 1966, and the Mellor Professor of Chemistry in 1972. When he retired in 1983, he was accorded the title of professor emeritus.

Corbett's research at Otago was primarily concerned with the study and structural elucidation of essential oils isolated from New Zealand native plants by steam distillation. Under his supervision in 1970, doctoral student Denis Lauren first isolated the diterpene compound from the rimu tree ("Dacrydium cupressinum") that came to be known as laurenene. Corbett also investigated extractives from barks, leaves, heartwoods and lichens, and determined the structures of many new, and derivatives of known, di-, tri- and sesquiterpenoids. He also studied the synthesis and rearrangement of some of the compounds that his team isolated.

In retirement, the Corbetts lived in Tauranga. Enid Corbett died there in 2012, and Ted Corbett died on 3 February 2018, also in Tauranga.

In 1972, Corbett was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He was also a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Chemistry.

Marianna Salzmann

Marianna Salzmann (born 21 August 1985) is a German dramatist, essayist and novelist. She is the "house playwright" (""Hausautorin"") at Berlin's Maxim Gorki Theater where between 2013 and 2015 she headed up the "Studio Я studio stage".

"Саша"/"Sasha" Marianna Salzmann was born in Volgograd which at that time was in the Soviet Union. She came from a family of physicians, and at one stage she too intended to become a doctor. She spent her early childhood in Moscow, taught to "be proud of her Jewish provenance, but not to mention it to anyone". While living in Russia the family did not use their German-Jewish name, but instead adopted a Russian style patronym. When she was ten her family, including her seven-year-old brother, emigrated to Germany as Jewish . She was able to bring with her only a suitcase full of books. They ended up in a succession of refugee placements until finding somewhere more permanent to live, in a village near Hanover.

Salzmann received theatre and ballet training while still in Russia, though she later asserted that her contributions in the infant ballerina classes were "frightful" (""...worin ich furchtbar war, oh Gott""). She began to write while still very young, exploring issues of language and identity, dealing with a new environment in which she felt discriminated against and marginalised. Themes of belonging and the destruction of realities appeared in her work: these would reappear in later theatre pieces and in her novel. Vague flickering figures disintegrate and float between identities. When her great grandfather Alexander ("Sasha") died she took his name to add to her own.

In 2003 Marianna Salzmann was a co-founder and for twelve years a contributing editor of , an "arts and society" magazine taking inspiration from the writer-philosopher , and appearing every six months. In 2005 she enrolled at the University of Hildesheim where her studies covered literature, theatre and media studies. Three years later she moved on to the Berlin University of the Arts from where she obtained a degree in Creative writing. While she was still at Hildesheim her first published poems and short stories appeared in various magazines. Her first theatre piece, "Weißbrotmusik" ("literally: "white bread music""), won a "Prize of the Vienese Wordsmiths" (""Preis der Wiener Wortstaetten"") in 2009.

While still at Hildesheim Salzmann staged "Ein Attentat auf Godot" ("loosely: "An attempt to finish off Godot""), an adaptation based on the Beckett classic, In 2012 she staged "Rot Werden" ("loosely: "Getting red""), a sarcastic love monologue addressed to Vladimir Putin. She teamed up with the "forte blau" music-theatre collective to develop projects for the deaf, partially deaf, and the hearing. She worked with the "Grenzkollektiv" on the Joan of Arc , "Joan of Arc is dead and she won't be back".

"Weißbrotmusik" won another significant prize, the "IKARUS 2012". It was also in 2012 that she received the "Kleist bursary-prize" for young dramatists with "Muttermale Fenster Blau" (""Blue Window Birthmarks""). Her final piece at the Berlin University of the Arts, "Muttersprache Mameloschn" (""Mother-tongue Yiddish"") was selected as best piece of the year, and awarded the 2013 Audience award. Both the writer and her pieces were well rated by theatre critics, among whom the results of a poll ranked her as best authoress and dramatist of the year from the younger generation (""Beste Nachwuchsautorin und Dramatikerin des Jahres""). After completing her studies, in 2014 Salzmann got together with to form the "New Institute for Dramatic Writing" (""Neues Institut für Dramatisches Schreiben""), "a new platform for self-driving authors": she taught political writing and set up workshops.

Since 2013 Salzmann has been "house playwright" (""Hausautorin"") at Berlin's Maxim Gorki Theater As head of the fee artists' group she is in charge of the Gorki Theater's "Studio Я". Critical reviews have been positive.

During her time in Istanbul, as a stipendiary at the , Salzmann began work on her first novel during 2012/13. She progressed the work during regular stays in Istanbul over the next four years. It was published in September 2017. The novel deals with a pair of twins whose early lives takes place in a small two room apartment in Moscow, after which they grow up in a home for asylum seekers in western Germany. Early on the novel won its author a €15,000 Jürgen Ponto foundation. The jury commended the work as a "bold and successful balance between cultural and gender identities" and as a "multi-faceted generation panorama from the twentieth century Soviet Union to twenty-first century Europe".

World Snooker Championship: Season 2007-08 (video game)

World Snooker Championship: Season 2007-08 (Or, "WSC" 07-08) is a sport simulation video game, released for the Nintendo DS on October 26, 2007. "WSC 07-08" was the first in the World Snooker Championship video games series to be released exclusively for handheld consoles. The game received average to poor reviews from critics, with both the overly hard AI, and lack of network modes being a major concern.

"WSC 2007-08", unlike other releases in the World Snooker Championship video games series, was released for the Nintendo DS, and would add the moniker of "Season" to the games' title. The game used the DS's dual-screen and stylus to control the game; although traditional D-pad controls are still available in game. The game featured single-player and two-player game modes in both Snooker, and Pool, however, unlike the console versions, there was no network play modes available.

The game features similar controls to the other games in the series, also featuring commentary by John Virgo. The game features a "Championship", "Challenge mode", "Quick Play", and "friendly mode".

Video Gaming review aggregation website "Game Rankings" scored the game at 56%. Handheld gaming reviewer "Pocket Gamer" scored the game at 6/10, saying that they enjoyed the stylus control scheme of the game, and that on the "whole the control system works well" However, they were also hesitant about the game's gameplay, saying "movement around the table is disappointingly jerky" "EuroGamer" were also positive regarding the game's design, saying "Its (Sic) debut on DS plays pretty much as a snooker game should," but later said that "it [was] difficult to be precise without a lot of faff"
Video Game Review website "Hexus.net" reviewed the game, but were confused by the game's difficulty, wrapping up their review saying "A decent snooker sim for when you’re on the move, but expect a serious challenge," and called it "too difficult". "Videogamer.com" agreed that the game's AI was too difficult, calling it "unreasonable".
One of the biggest issues from critics was the lack of a network mode, that players had to "swap the DS back and forth" if playing a multiplayer game. "EuroGamer" humorously stating the game had "missed a trick(shot)" by not including the function. "Pocket Gamer" were bemused with the decision to leave out this game mode stating "It surely couldn't have been too hard to include a wireless multiplayer option or even online matches? It's a real missed opportunity." "videogamer.com" were also scathing about the omition "The lack of wireless multiplayer is a real killer and an oversight that is quite unforgivable for a sports title."

Corraclassy

Corraclassy () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.

Corraclassy is bounded on the north by Drumbeagh townland, on the west by Tullandreen townland, on the south by Gubnagree and Corranierna (Corlough) townlands and on the east by Garvary (Corlough) and Curraghabweehan townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan) and dug wells. Corraclassy is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 56 statute acres.

In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.

A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Curraghclassy". In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, ""Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate"". 

The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list one tithepayer in the townland.

The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The soil is of a boggy light nature...a corn mill and kiln".

In 1841 the population of the townland was 21, being 12 males and 9 females. There were three houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.

In 1851 the population of the townland was 14, being 6 males and 8 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were twelve houses in the townland, all inhabited.

Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists two landholders in the townland.

In 1861 the population of the townland was 14, being 5 males and 9 females. There were two houses in the townland and all were inhabited.

In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are three families listed in the townland.

Ngulungbara

The Ngulungbara were an indigenous Australian people or clan of the state of Queensland.

The Ngulingbara's status as an independent tribe has been contested, since some authorities consider them to have been a horde of the Butchulla, since the -"bara" suffix in their ethnonym is suggestive of a clan grouping. They occupied a sector of Fraser Island north of Boomerang Hill and, in Norman Tindale's estimate, inhabited an area of some .

Henrietta Bingham

Henrietta Bingham (January 3, 1901 – June 17, 1968) was a wealthy American socialite, journalist, newspaper executive and horse breeder. When she was twelve she was in the car when her mother was killed in a road accident which traumatized her whole family. After this she developed a very close relationship with her father who took a long time to recognize her lesbianism but eventually became reconciled to her sexuality. She was an anglophile flapper in the 1920s who became associated with the Bloomsbury Group and who had a succession of partners, eventually having a brief and unsuccessful marriage. She owned and ran a Kentucky estate for breeding thoroughbred racehorses.

Henrietta Worth Bingham was born in Louisville, Kentucky on January 3, 1901 to Robert Worth Bingham (1871–1937), a lawyer who was an aspiring politician, and Eleanor "Babes" Miller (1870–1913) who had married in 1896. Her father's family had become prosperous in textiles and her mother came from a family that had become very wealthy in the engineering industry. Henrietta had two brothers: Robert Worth Bingham (1897–1965) and George Barry Bingham (1906–1988). As a child she was strong, competitive and good at many sports, particularly tennis. When she was twelve Henrietta's mother was killed in a road accident at a level crossing. Henrietta and Barry, her younger brother, were present in the car at the time and the whole family was traumatized.

Henrietta Bingham was attractive and charismatic, and, as she passed through her adolescence, she took advantage of this, flirting with boys, and, noticeably to many people, her father. She became her father's favorite over her brothers and he petted and spoiled her. In 1916 her father married Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, reputed to be "the wealthiest woman in the United States", having inherited $100 million when her elderly first husband Henry Flagler died. After less than one year of marriage on July 27, 1917 Mary Lily died, aged fifty. It was kept secret that she had died through alcohol and morphine addiction. When her will was contested the court case revealed that she and her stepchildren had got on extremely badly and the newspapers encouraged the suspicion that Henrietta and her brothers were somehow to do with her death, and that their father might be a murderer. In 1911 he had been appointed as a judge on the circuit court and in 1918 with the money he inherited, the Judge (as he came to be called always) purchased two Louisville newspapers – the "Courier–Journal" and the "Louisville Times". Henrietta developed a love of jazz and, against the mores of their society, the Judge allowed this – she took up playing the saxophone. She did well at school and in 1920 she became the first member of her family to enter an elite university: Smith College.

At Smith, the women's liberal arts college, new entrants were required to pass further exams to be allowed to continue into the next calendar year. Henrietta struggled and was persuaded to try again for re-entry in 1921. She formed a friendship with her English composition instructor, Mina Kirstein (sister of Lincoln Kirstein) and they became so close as to declare their love for each other. When her readmission was confirmed Henrietta, with her father and younger brother, went on their annual visit to Britain at the same time as Kirstein was there visiting Harold Laski and his wife. With Kirstein, the Binghams mingled with modernist society in Britain. When Henrietta restarted her freshman year at Smith she again got into difficulty, not only academically but also by not keeping to the college's regulations. In 1922, now a full-fledged flapper with cropped hair and a poor reputation, she was asked to leave the college.

So that her father would not know that she could not continue her education, Bingham pretended to him that the college was allowing her time away to study in Europe and, quite separately, Kirstein sought and was granted study leave in Europe too. The Bingham family travelled separately from Kirstein to England but, when it was time for the rest of the Binghams to return home Henrietta persuaded her father to let her stay on with Kirstein as chaperone. The two women, besotted with each other, set off on a grand tour of continental Europe.
Kirstein did not see a future for them as fully sexual lovers and from Carcasonne she wrote a twelve-page letter to Ernest Jones, the leading Freudian psychoanalyst in Britain at a time when psychoanalysis was generally regarded as dangerously aberrant. In it she asked for help for an attractive 21-year-old American woman with irrational fears and a "homosexual tendency" possibly due to her childhood experiences. She wrote that Bingham had then developed an attraction to Kirstein herself saying "I am not a homosexual, though I love her very much". She said that neither of them was ashamed of their relationship but they wanted to move on to another stage in their lives. Bingham reluctantly agreed to psychoanalysis in London and refused to return to America even when her father asked for her urgently. When the Judge traveled to England at the end of 1922 he visited Jones and was satisfied that Henrietta's anxiety was being treated properly.

Kirstein and Bingham enjoyed the bohemian nightlife in London and through David Garnett they made contact with the Bloomsbury Group. To allow them to stay in Britain Garnett suggested the couple might rent Tidmarsh Mill, the home of Lytton Strachey, Dora Carrington and her then husband Ralph Partridge, while the owners were away for the summer. When they arrived to view the property Carrington found Kirstein lovely, with a perfect slim figure, and Bingham was "my style, pink with a round face, dressed in mannish clothes, with a good natural style". Carrington was disappointed when they left, but they had seemed to pay little attention to her. Anyway, Strachey refused their offer to rent the mill – he could not face having them living in the house. Back in London they met Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes and Duncan Grant. Although not an intellectual Bingham was in her element – her exoticism and sensuality enraptured the Bloomsberries – and was in the vanguard of bringing the Harlem Renaissance to Britain by playing the saxophone and singing spirituals and songs of the American South in her dusky voice. Carrington wrote she "almost made love to her in public" and then found from Garnett that Bingham had been continually asking after her and wanting to see her again.

In his continuing therapy sessions Jones, with Kirstein's agreement, had been encouraging Bingham to take a male partner. She had already caught the eye of Stephen Tomlin who was charismatic, widely-read, and an accomplished writer and sculptor. They became lovers but she also turned to other partners from time to time. Both she and Tomlin had partners of both sexes.

Back in Kentucky Bingham was unsettled, partly because she was disapproved of there. Her contemporaries knew she was "crazy about girls" though her father had not yet realized. He gave her the job of book editor in the local "Courier–Journal" newspaper he owned. With her brother Barry, she took the initiative of opening a book store, which only stocked literary books – those that Garnet sent in crates from his book store in London. Tomlin flooded her with letters asking her to return to Britain and, via Garnet, she asked if he would marry her. Tomlin wrote back equivocally because he wanted her as a lover but not as a wife. Bingham had thought marriage would sort out all the misunderstandings she was having with the other people close to her. However, she still visited Kirstein and they again expressed their love for each other.

Early in 1924 there was a serious crisis in the Bingham household. The result was that Bingham and her father became much more distant and he broke off all contact with Kirstein. The likeliest explanation was that someone had told her father about her lesbian relationship with Kirstein.

In June 1924 Bingham returned in England and she again become strongly involved with the Bloomsbury social life. When Tomlin took her to Tidmarsh Mill she deliberately started to initiate an affair with Carrington. Kirstein was due to arrive in Britain and on the day before (and the day after her father left) Henrietta spent the whole afternoon with Carrington which, Carrington said, "no one knew of but us" referring to "ecstasy ... and no feelings of shame afterwards". Henrietta was her first and only female lover although Carrington found many women attractive to the point of having feelings of love or lust for them. Carrington wrote to her close friend Gerald Brenan, that she "killed my desires for "les jeunes garçons" pretty completely". While Bingham and Tomlin remained a couple, on one occasion she spent the night with Carrington 
at the "ménage à trois"'s new house Ham Spray. In due course Carrington wrote to Brenan "of certain sensations and wish to God [she] was here so I could repeat them".

Henrietta's family arrived to take a holiday in Scotland and while on the grouse moors her father told her they would be returning early to London for him to get married for the third time, to Aleen Hilliard (née Muldoon) – Henrietta vomited for five hours on hearing the news. Back in London, Dr. Jones told his wife "General frightful crises with Binghamesque scenes". She irrationally thought her father's marriage was to punish her. With Carrington, Tomlin and Kirstein all in despair over being repeatedly attracted and rejected by Bingham, Kirstein and Bingham returned to America and Kirstein fell in love with Harry Curtiss, who she described as "a very male Henrietta", and married him in 1926, after his divorce. She remained a lifelong friend of Henrietta, however. For Christmas Henrietta departed to the French Riviera with two girlfriends where she was photographed out walking in men's clothes, arm in arm with her two friends.

After returning to America, Henrietta disliked living in Kentucky so she moved to a newly-built apartment at 25 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan where she started working for the monthly magazine "Theatre Arts" to increase its advertising receipts and circulation. She was rapidly accepted into New York society and her apartment became a gathering place particularly for Southerners, both black and white. When she met John Houseman she swept him off his feet and, as he later reflected, it was the first and only time he "was ever really in love". He was invited back to her family home for Christmas and by the new year they were secretly engaged – their relationship was intense, romantic and unconsummated. 1926 was spent mostly on the moors of Scotland and in London where she formed a loving relationship with Alix Strachey. After a separation of over a year Houseman joined her in England where they consummated their relationship and let it be known they would marry and would go to live in America. Even on the voyage back they seriously quarrelled and by the summer of 1927 the relationship was over.

Bingham's relationship with Houseman having ended, Kirstein and Jones encouraged her to find another heterosexual male partner but, unfortunately, she was being deluged with letters from Beatrix Lehmann, an actress she had met in Britain and who she had invited to join the Bingham family's 1927 holiday in Scotland where they had been "more than just friends". When her family returned home Henrietta stayed with Beatrix at the home of Rosamond Lehmann, Beatrix's sister, and wrote syndicated articles for US newspapers about the English social scene, later turning to more serious topics such as the treatment of prisoners in European countries. By the end of the 1920s her father had come to realize, and even tolerate, her sexuality provided that, when in Kentucky, she wore a skirt.

On the spur of the moment in 1930, Henrietta bought a Bentley Speed Six Mulliner drophead coupé and she and Beatrix set off on a tour of Europe going via Stockholm to Berlin, Munich and Paris, enjoying the Roaring Twenties night life. In 1932 she joined the Judge in actively and financially supporting Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign for the presidency, leading to her father's appointment next year to be US Ambassador to the United Kingdom. She accompanied her father and her stepmother to London where she easily socialized with the younger aristocracy.

In 1934 the embassy held a reception for the U.S. Wightman Cup team. As a girl Henrietta had been good at tennis and had won many trophies so she knew about Helen Jacobs, the leading member of the U.S. team who was daring enough to wear shorts on court. Henrietta set about attracting Jacobs and went to all her matches. The U.S team won easily but at the Wimbledon Championships Ladies' Singles Jacobs lost in the final to Dorothy Round and then, according to the press, "rested ... with Miss Bingham ... at her [weekend] home in Sunningdale". After winning the 1934 US Open she sailed to Britain with Henrietta and stayed with her until she could rent her own apartment and where she started writing a novel.
The two women spent the winter together with Jacobs taking up foxhunting, already a passion of Bingham's and becoming enraptured with her partner. On an occasion while the ambassador and his wife were away, Henrietta threw a party at the family residence – the Prince of Wales and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. were there – Jacobs wrote that it was a glorious success. Jacobs effectively became part of the Bingham household and she formed a good mutual friendship with Henrietta's father.

In 1935 the two women went to live together near Louisville while the ambassador and his wife stayed in London. Henrietta purchased a magnificent 450-acre country estate, called Harmony Landing, at Goshen intending to use it for breeding thoroughbred horses and pedigree dogs. In 1936 Jacobs won her Wimbledon singles final against the German Hilde Sperling which produced, according to the "New York Times" "probably the most wholehearted ovation Wimbledon will ever know". By this time there was strong anti-Nazi feeling in Britain and particularly in the Bingham family. Jacobs and Bingham were photographed together and were reported as being "almost inseparable". Shortly before his death in December 1937, Robert Bingham resigned his ambassadorship. The two women felt they had to stand separately at the funeral – by the late 1930s anti-homosexual attitudes were becoming more widespread in America.

The death of the Judge took its toll on Henrietta and, unable to socialize freely, she and Helen concentrated on thoroughbred horse breeding. Her father's will left her what was, for her, a rather low income but her younger brother Barry Bingham helped by appointing her treasurer of the Louisville "Courier–Journal" that he now owned. When Jacobs returned to Europe for the 1938 tennis season Bingham had to stay behind to manage the estate and that winter Jacobs could not stay at Gosham for prolonged periods because of the social ostracism. Bingham started drinking more heavily and their relationship was drifting apart.

The horse breeding business was reasonably successful but Bingham suffered a nervous breakdown and afterwards she required periodic hospitailzation and nursing care at home. She was advised to undergo electroconvulsive therapy and frontal lobotomy to counter her depression and erratic behavior but she refused these treatments.

In 1950 she sold her Goshen estate and moved to Manhattan where she found a new, and older, partner Dorothie Bigelow, a singer and actress. and in 1954 she married Benjamin Franklin McKenzie, younger than her by ten years – he seemingly was a waiter at a nightclub and had been married twice before. The partnership only lasted a few months until McKenzie deserted her,
going to live in Florida. She visited England, meeting Garnett, Jones and a few other old friends. In 1956 she took an overdose and, when she was taken to hospital, her rooms were found to contain a mass of different drugs, prescribed by a variety of doctors. Bingham lived on until 1968 with a paid nurse to look after her.
She died on June 17, 1968 and was buried beside her father at Cave Hill Cemetery, Louisville.

Pakodanomics

Pakodanomics refers to the economic policies instituted in India to encourage self employment and entrepreneurship.

The term originated from a comment made by the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi in January 2018 stating that street food vendors (selling pakodas) should also be considered in employment statistics and hence unemployment in the country is actually much lower than statistically reported.

One of the main concerns of the Indian economy during the BJP government has been increasing employment opportunities for the huge number of youth entering the work force. It is estimated that over one million new people join the work force every month in India while the economy added approximately half a million formal jobs in the whole of the previous year.

Pakodanomics was also a result of demonetization which was the sudden banning of 86% of currency in India in November 2016 that led to major economic upheaval.

Pakodanomics also became a light-hearted reference to the economic policies of the government and there were many comedic references at campaign rallies and on television. Commentators seriously tried to dissect the government's policies and realized that in fact that the policies of the government were not generating enough formal employment.

William Strudwick Arrasmith

William Strudwick Arrasmith (July 15, 1898 – November 30, 1965) was an American architect known for his designs for Greyhound bus stations in the Streamline Moderne style popular in the 1930s and 1940s. Among the over 60 stations he designed are the Cleveland Greyhound Bus Station (1948), the Montgomery, Alabama, Greyhound Bus Station (1951), and the Evansville, Illinois, Greyhound Bus Terminal (1938) which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

William Arrasmith was born on July 15, 1898, to Thomas and Mary Strudwick at Hillsboro, North Carolina, in the United States. He studied at the University of North Carolina and graduated from the University of Illinois with a bachelor of science degree in architecture in 1921.

He met his future wife, Elizabeth "Betty" Beam, at Illinois. They had a daughter Anne.

Arrasmith moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1922 where he worked with Fred Morgan, E.T. Hutchings, and Brinton Davis. In 1929 he went into partnership with Herman Wischmeyer as "Wischmeyer, Arrasmith, and Elswick". The firm's notable buildings included the Federal Land Bank and the Louisville Scottish Rite Temple (on which Arrasmith is not credited). He was later in partnership with Bill Tyler as Arrasmith & Tyler which later became "Arrasmith & Judd" and then "Arrasmith, Judd, Rapp & Associates". As of 2015 the firm was trading as "Arrasmith, Judd, Rapp, Chovan, Inc."

He was known for his designs for Greyhound bus stations in the Streamline Moderne style that was popular in the 1930s and 40s. His first design for the company was a terminal in Louisville that opened in 1937. He also designed stations for the company in Columbus, Dayton, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. Among the prime examples of his work is the Cleveland Greyhound Bus Station (1948) which is on the National Register of Historic Places along with eight of his other station designs. In total he designed over 60 stations for the company.

Other work by Arrasmith in the Louisville region included the "Methodist Evangelical Hospital", the Police School, the science building and medical apartments for the University of Louisville, the 800 Apartments Building, Kentucky Fairgrounds, Kentucky Hotel, Byck's Department Store (St. Matthews and 4th Street), and buildings for Western Kentucky University.

Arrasmith was in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while at Illinois and was in command of a veteran company in 1933. Following the Ohio River flood of 1937 he led efforts to build a pontoon bridge to link Louisville's downtown to the East End. During the Second World War he served with the United States Army 6th Corps Engineers in Europe and rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army reserves.

Arrasmith died on November 30, 1965, in Louisville, Kentucky. A collection of his papers is held by The Filson Historical Society. A book by Frank E. Wrenick devoted to Arrasmith's Greyhound designs was published by McFarland in 2006.

The Girona headquarters of the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia contains materials found during archaeological excavations at various sites in the province of Girona, dating from prehistory to the Middle Ages.

The museum was founded as the Provincial Museum of Antiquities and Fine Arts in 1846 by the Provincial Monument Commission, and is therefore one of the oldest museums in Catalonia. Between 1846 and 1857 the Museum had several different locations, until Sant Pere de Galligants monastery in 1857, where it has remained until today, and where it was given the name by which it is popularly known.

The building where the Museum is located is a remarkable example of Catalan Romanesque architecture from the 12th century. Its foundation date is not known, but it existed already in the first half of the 10th century. In 1836 it was abandoned by the community of Benedictine monks who lived there, due to the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal. Today, the Museum occupies the cloister and the Romanesque church, as well as the area above the cloister, built in the second half of the 19th century. Since 1992 the Museum has been part of the Archaeology Museum of Catalonia, run by the Catalan Cultural Heritage Agency.

Windsor Court

Windsor Court is a large house in Wick Lane, Englefield Green, Egham, Surrey, England. It adjoins Windsor Great Park.

The 37,000 sq ft house was built as Park Close in about 1900 in an eclectic mix of styles, most notably Arts & Crafts. It has ten bedrooms, ten bathrooms and 5 reception rooms. The estate includes 15 acres of mature gardens, cottages, stables and a large dower house.

Park Close was owned in its early years by the civil engineer and politician Urban Hanlon Broughton as his summer residence. In 1930, his widow Mrs Urban H. Broughton was still living there and at 37 Grosvenor Square, London. In 1949, it was home to Norman Greenlees Weir.

In 2004, it was bought for £8 million, by "resolutely anonymous" owners, but they apparently never moved in or did any work on the house, except to rebrand it as Windsor Court.

In April 2015, it was listed for sale at £19.9 million, having been reduced from £25 million. As of February 208, it is still listed for sale at £19.9 million. According to "The New York Times", the house could be refurbished, but is "more likely to be knocked down and replaced".

130th Field Artillery Regiment

The 130th Field Artillery Regiment is a United States Army field artillery regiment, represented in the Kansas Army National Guard by the 2nd Battalion, 130th Field Artillery, part of the 130th Field Artillery Brigade at Hiawatha, Kansas.

The regiment was originally organized in 1917 after the United States entry into World War I as the 1st Field Artillery of the Kansas National Guard. Later that year, it mustered into Federal service and was reorganized as the 130th Field Artillery, fighting with the 35th Division in the American Expeditionary Forces in France. After the end of World War I the regiment returned home and was demobilized, briefly reverting to its state designation. In 1921 it became the 130th Field Artillery again and was assigned to the 35th Division. Inducted into Federal service during World War II, the regiment was broken up into the 130th and 154th Field Artillery Battalions in 1942, which were relieved from the 35th Division. 

The 130th Field Artillery remained stateside until late 1944, when it was sent to Europe, serving in Germany in the final months of the war. The 154th was sent to the Pacific and fought in the Aleutian Islands Campaign. Postwar, both battalions returned to state service, with the 130th becoming the 130th Armored Field Artillery Battalion. In 1959 both battalions consolidated as the 130th Artillery under the Combat Arms Regimental System.

Marquette River West

The Marquette West River is a tributary of the Marquette River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, in the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada.

The Marquette West River flows successively into the townships of Huard, Buade, Poutrincourt and Cramahé. The course of this river is located west of the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.

The forest road R0212 (East-West direction) intersects the middle section of the Marquette River West. The route 167 linking Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec passes on the north-east side of the Normandin River and on the Northeast of Ashuapmushuan Lake.

The surface of the Marquette West River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

This hydronym evokes the work of life of Jacques Marquette (Laon, France, 1637 - near Luddington, Michigan, 1675). He was a Jesuit missionary and explorer. He first studied Amerindian languages, then he devoted himself to various missions including the Outaouais; in 1671, he founded the mission of Saint-Ignace, among the Wendat (Hurons), on the north shore of Michilimakinac Strait. In 1672, he met Louis Jolliet with whom he would reach the Mississippi River. He will explore this river to the present border of Arkansas and Louisiana. Wanting to start a mission with the Kaskaskias in the land of Illinois, Father Marquette reluctantly relinquishes it because of illness.

The toponym "Rivière Marquette Ouest" was formalized on March 28, 1972 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec..

Sunfield G. A. R. Hall

The Sunfield G. A. R. Hall, also known as the Sunfield Grand Army of the Republic Post No. 283 Hall, is a hall built for the Grand Army of the Republic fraternal organization, located at 115 Main Street in Sunfield, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The building has been in continuous use by organizations of Civil War veterans and their descendants since its construction.

The Grand Army of the Republic was organized in 1866 as a fraternal organization for Union veterans of the |Civil War. Although a Michigan section was initially organized in 1867, it became inactive, and was reorganized in 1879. However, the organization quickly caught on in the state, with nearly 400 posts formed over the next 15 years. This included the Samuel W. Grinnell Post No. 283, chartered in Sunfield on October 6, 1884. The post was named after Sergeant Samuel W. Grinnell, who had died in 1883. Grinnell had seen action in the Battle of Shiloh, and later served as Sunfield's village clerk, treasurer and as a justice of the peace.

The post first met in a private home, then in a room above a local blacksmith shop, then later at the Sunfield Odd Fellows Hall. By 1898, the membership had grown to 32, and the post decided to construct their own hall. Land was purchased, and in 1899 work began constructing this building. The building was dedicated on September 15, 1899. Later that year, two cannon captured in the Spanish–American War were put in place. The building continued to be used by the post through the first three decades of the twentieth century. However, by 1929, only two members remained, and the last member died in 1934.

However, other organizations consisting of decedents of Civil War veterans have used and maintained the hall. Among these were the Women's Relief Corps #62, who used the building from 1899 to 1925 and the Samuel W. Grinnell Camp #17, Sons of Union Veterans, from 1918 to 1936. The Helen M. Edwins Tent #30, Daughters of Union Veterans of the Civil War, began using the hall in 1926, and (as of the 1980s) owned the property. the Curtenius Guard Camp #17, Sons of Union Veterans of the Civil War, began using the hall in 1983, and continue to meet there.

The Sunfield G. A. R. Hall is a rectangular, single story, front-gable, clapboarded building, with a false front topped by a pressed metal cornice. Atop the cornice is a plaque with the building's construction date, 1899, and the initials G. A. R. The building has a metal roof and fieldstone foundation. The front and side walls of the hall contain two-over-two windows in plain board frames. Two cannon sit in front of the building.

On the interior, the building is divided into three rooms: a small entry vestibule, the nearby cloakroom, and the main hall. A door with peephole separates the vestibule from the main hall. The main hall remains largely as furnished by the original members of the G. A. R. post, including members' chairs, weapons and medals and flags and other effects.

The term "STRO-1" then was applied to the antigen for this antibody. In human body, STRO-1 exists in many organs, like lung and liver.

Camp Cawa-Cawa siege

The Camp Cawa-Cawa siege (Filipino: "Pagkubkob sa Kampo Cawa-Cawa", Chavacano: "Sitio de Campo Cawa-Cawa") was a siege of a Philippine Constabulary-Integrated National Police camp by security forces of the Philippines in January 1989 after a rogue policeman took the camp's ranking officer hostage.

Rizal Alih, a patrolman, and several other men had been detained pending an investigation into their alleged involvement in the murder of Zamboanga City Mayor Cesar Climaco on 14 November 1984. Gen. Eduardo Batalla, the regional commander of the PC-INP who had his office at the camp, had made a decision to have the detained men transferred to Manila, however Alih refused to cooperate. Batalla had summoned the men to his office for a conference, but the talks degenerated into a heated exchange with both parties shouting at each other. Alih and his companions were able to over-power their guards and took Batalla, his aide Col. Romeo Abendan and several others hostage.

After a 3-day siege, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Renato de Villa ordered that the camp be assaulted. Philippine security forces decided to attack the camp using helicopters. Rockets deployed from the aircraft set fire to the building where Gen. Batalla was being held and it burned to the ground. Batalla, Abendan and 18 other PC/INP personnel were later found burned to death. Alih managed to escape the ruined camp, making his way to Basilan and eventually Sabah, Malaysia.

Alih was arrested by Malaysian authorities in September 1994 and charged with illegal possession of firearms. He was extradited back to the Philippines in 2006. He was detained in Camp Crame and died in the camp's hospital on 14 August 2015 after complaining of chest pains. He was buried the next day in Zamboanga City.

The Philippine National Police commemorates the deaths of Gen. Batalla and Col. Abendan every year. Camp Cawa-Cawa itself was renamed Camp Brigadier General Eduardo B Batalla, and another Philippine National Police camp in Mercedes, Zamboanga City was named Camp Colonel Romeo A Abendan in honor of the slain police officers.

A film depicting events related to the siege was released in March 1989. Directed by Carlo J. Caparas, "Arrest: Patrolman Rizal Alih, Zamboanga Massacre" starred Ramon Revilla as Rizal Alih and Eddie Garcia as Gen. Eduardo Batalla.

Andaç, Uludere

Andaç is a village in the district of Uludere in Sirnak province, in southeastern Turkey. The village is around away from the district of Uludere and it is located in southeastern Turkey, just on the western border of the Hakkari province. The village was an ancient Assyrian settlement and was part of Assyria.

The former name of the village is "Halmon", which had Assyrian people living there since the 6th century. There are two intact Syriac churches still in the village and a large number of house ruins on the upper part in the Yarma village ("Gérāmon"), which is currently part of Andaç. Lying to the west of Tyari, the village is known to have been the birthplace of the Bishop Mār Ṭūrīs of Māḥozé d-Aryon, who lived in the early 7th century. Additionally, the history of Rabbān Yawsip Busnāyā records the presence of Syriac Christians at Halmon, during the mid-10th century.

Prior to Seyfo in 1915, Halmon was a purely Assyrian settlement comprising over 60 households, with a 4th-century church dedicated to St. Shmuni. The Assyrians of Halmon were settled in the village of Cham-Suske, in the Dohuk province of northern Iraq, in 1922. Later on, they were resettled in the village of Tell-Jum'ah, along the Khabur River in Syria, in 1935.

To the east, Geramon was another Assyrian village home to more than 80 households, with a 6th-century church dedicated to St. John the Arab. From 1922 onward, the Assyrians of Geramon were resettled in northern Iraq.

Bordering Northern Iraq and within the upper reaches of Mesopotamia, the village sits between high mountains and is situated within a valley. There is a river nearby. The village has a dry-summer humid continental climate. Summers are hot and virtually dry with maximum temperatures reaching over 33 °C and winters being cold and wet, where maximum temperatures hover around 4 °C. Snowfall is common in winter and rainfall is more pronounced in spring. The area's vegetation is Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub, but more temperate grassland in the upper areas. The Assyrian village of Gérāmon (Yarma) is less than to the east and is usually incorporated within Andaç with the area being designated as Andaç-Yarma.

The economy of the village is based on agriculture and animal husbandry. In addition to the settlement, labor and temporary village guards are being built.

There are three primary schools in the village and one secondary school called "Andaç Yarma Intermediate School". The water network of the village is available and there is no sewer network.

Halcyornithidae

Halcyornithidae or Pseudasturidae is a family of fossil birds, possibly belonging to the order Psittaciformes (parrots and relatives). Members of this family lived in the Eocene, around 55-48 millions years ago. Fossil remains are known from the Green River Formation in the United States and from the London Clay formation in the United Kingdom. They were probably the sister group to the owl-like Messelasturidae.

Black stane

Black Stane or stone examinations are peculiar to the ancient universities of Scotland, in particular the University of St Andrews and University of Glasgow.

The black stanes date to the foundation of each university and were used for viva examinations with a set time, later recorded using a time glass to denote for how long the student would be expected to talk about the breadth and depth of his subject, normally in Latin.

The University of Glasgow black Stane exams lasted 20 minutes, the bedullus bearing the university mace turned the time glass and the exam began. When all of the sand ran out the bedullus shouted "fluxit" which is Latin for the sand "has flowed through". If the examiners were pleased the student passed the exam but if not, the timer was turned over and the student had to repeat the exam.. Black stane exams lasted in Glasgow from the foundation in 1451 to the middle of the nineteenth century, though it is used for some exams.

The Glasgow black stane was enclosed in a wooden chair in 1775, with brass inlaid plates showing the arms of the University and the names of the founders, Pope Nicholas V, King James II of Scotland and Bishop Turnbull of Glasgow on the front of the chair. On the back are carved the Royal Arms of Scotland and the Royal Arms of England.

The St Andrews black stane was used from its foundation in 1410 and like Glasgow, until the middle of the nineteenth century. It was located in Old Parliament house, St Mary's college, from the late sixteenth century until the University Museum was founded in 2008. Students would be examined standing on the St Andrews black stane and the exam would last up to 60 minutes, according to the degree to be awarded.

Suddenly, her father marries a woman rich enough to own a building. Meanwhile, Jung Eun Tae works as a doctor. He volunteered for performing medical service abroad, but he comes back to Korea.

Whereas the eldest daughter Seonha looked after the siblings like a mother, Yuha was the type who would give her younger siblings a lesson. The fact that she got into medical school made her the pride and joy of the family. When she got married to Seongun, a millionaire's son, she was called a Cinderella and became the envy of many women.

As she did for Seongun, she starts to endure everything for her lovely daughter Eunsu.
He's an internist at Jahan Hospital. He is a cranky doctor who takes the lead in going on voluntary medical service abroad. He may be a rogue, but he's the finest doctor. People call him an arrogant, rude and unruly "mad dog," but he doesn't mind it at all because thank to this nickname, no other doctor would try to get on his nerves. Surprisingly, he is the most caring brother and uncle to his older sister and his niece, and he's as generous as a saint to his patients. His late father was in the forefront of overseas medical services. Back then, he resented his father for being neglectful of his family while he was busy taking care of his patients. But when he followed his father's footsteps and served in Africa, at last he came to understand his father. But as a side effect, he decided not to get married. Dating is fine, but forget marriage. He doesn't want to hurt his family like his father did. He would commit to practicing medicine for his entire life. After serving in Africa for several years, he returns to Korea when his brother-in-law, who is the director of Jahan Hospital, calls for help.

This man of perseverance has been making handmade shoes for several decades at the same spot. Ever since his wife passed away, he has been sacrificing his life for his children, who mean the world to him along with shoes. However, wind suddenly starts blowing in his peaceful life. He had wished that his eldest daughter would marry a reliable man, but she brings a younger boyfriend as a potential spouse. His town, where he's been living all his life, becomes target of redevelopment. On top of all, his first love, Miyeon, shows up after 36 years, just like a storm. And she's no ordinary woman. She's a proud building owner.
She is a woman of overbearing haughtiness. But she's also a majestic and elegant landlord. She is arrogant, but she behaves with common decency. She is rude, but she keeps it within bounds. She makes poignant remarks, but she only says the right things. That's why even her audacity and evil tongue seem to make her more charming. Every single investment she makes hits the jackpot, and everything prospers with her. Nevertheless, her life was not without a few bumps on the road. After her husband ran off overseas when his company went bankrupt, she started from the bottom and kept on rolling until she came to own a building. Although she is enjoying a glamorous single life, she feels empty inside somehow. To recollect the happiest time of her life, she decides to restore the house in which she lived with her father in her twenties. Then she comes across Hyoseop, her first love and object of her hatred.

<doc id="56576130" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56576130" title="Katzenberg Hillfort">
Katzenberg Hillfort

Katzenberg Hillfort ( or "Römerwarte Mayen") is a Roman refuge fort near Mayen in Germany dating to the 4th century.

The fortification on the Katzenberg hill was built around 300 AD after the Roman "limes" had been overrun and Germanic tribes had invaded and plundered the Roman Empire (the so-called "Limesfall"). The inhabitants of the Roman "vicus", which was located on the site of the present-day town of Mayen, could escape to the fort in time of danger. At that time, town walls were built around the provincial capitals of Trier, Cologne and Mainz, as well as around smaller places like Koblenz or Andernach. The Katzenberg was the largest of about 60 Late Roman hillforts which were constructed in the Eifel and Hunsrück regions. They were used for about 70 years and then, after a 30-year pause, used again, in some cases until about 450 AD. On the uppermost crest of the hill is a small military outpost, the lower-lying open areas were probably used by the civilian population in the event of a threat. The fort covered an area of 1.2 hectares.

The remains of the Late Roman hillfort were discovered around 1900 and excavated for the first time between 1907 and 1932. After a long pause, excavations were re-started in 1997 as part of the Volcano Park project. The finds were archaeologically investigated in Koblenz and the town of Mayen under the direction of the state office for cultural heritage.

For the history of handicrafts the roofing finds were especially important. The roof slates found in the round towers were, surprisingly, shaped like scales, something which was rare in Roman times. 

In 2000, parts of the defensive wall and two round towers were reconstructed on original foundations of the walls. On the remains of the old military station on the hilltop, which had underfloor heating in the form of a hypocaust, a protective structure was built. All roofs were covered in slates in the form of scales and hexagons (for protection).

Sargent Kahanamoku

Sargent Hiikua Kahanamoku (March 5, 1910 – May 16, 1993) was a Native Hawaiian aquatic athlete, and public relations spokesperson for Standard Oil Company. Sculptor Malvina Hoffman used him as her model for part of The Races of Mankind exhibit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Sargent was the younger brother of Duke Kahanamoku.

He was the youngest son born into a family of Native Hawaiians headed by Duke Halapu Kahanamoku and Julia Paʻakonia Lonokahikina Paoa. Both parents were direct descendants of Kamehameha I. His brothers were Duke, Samuel, David, William and Louis, all of whom participated in competitive aquatic sports. His sisters were Bernice, Kapiolani and Maria.

In 1925, at age 15 years, he won the backstroke event to help his 7th Grade classmates win a YMCA meet in Honolulu. At age 20, when he attended Andover Academy in Massachusetts, he won a 50-yard freestyle competition against a Yale University competitor.

Sargent was part of a crew for the July 22, 1933 canoe races off the Kona coast. Five days later, he and his friend Paul Fagan Jr. became stranded off the shore 3-1/2 miles from Diamond Head when Fagan's speed boat ran out of fuel. With no radio or other equipment aboard to help them, and no other boaters within signaling range, they began to drift out to sea. In a self-rescue reported on the front page of the "Honolulu Star-Bulletin", with no rescue in sight, Sargent spent four hours towing the boat back to shore with one hand, while he used his feet and other hand to paddle through the water.

He and his brother Sam, along with Fred Wilhelm and Melvin Paoa, paddling for the Outrigger Canoe Club, won in the Junior 4 on June 11, 1937. Through the next decade, Sargent continued to compete in local aquatic meets in Hawaii. During the August 15, 1946 holiday celebrating the prior year's surrender of Japan (known then as alternately "Victory Over Japan Day" or "Veterans Day"), Sargent steered his crew of the "Kakina" outrigger to victory.

Circa 1939-1940, Sargent took up the game of golf. As he got older, his golf activities began to replace the more vigorous competitive aquatic sports.

In 1931, sculptor Malvina Hoffman used Sargent as her model for "Hawaiian Surf-Rider, Polynesia", part of The Races of Mankind exhibit at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The exhibit eventually went into storage, but was revived at the Field Museum in 2016. 

He went to work for Standard Oil as its Hawaiian public relations representative, a position he held for 38 years. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited Hawaii in July 1934, Sargent and his brother Sam were part of the official welcoming ceremonies at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

Sargent married school teacher Anna Furtado. She was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives, and to the State Senate after statehood was granted. The couple were King and Queen of Aloha Week in 1961. Sargent was appointed chairman of the Hawaiian Heart Fund in 1963. Anna died in 1969, and Sargent ran unsuccessfully for the State Senate on the Republican ticket. He later married for a second time to Mary Ray, who described him as a people lover and an infinite source of stories of Hawaii. When Sargent died in 1993, his memorial service was held at the Outrigger Canoe Club.

The album of solo piano performances by Nabatov was recorded in concert at Loft, in Cologne, on 22 September 2007. The eight pieces were all composed by pianist Herbie Nichols. "Nabatov tears down these compositions and re-engineers the various melodies and structures."

"Spinning Songs of Herbie Nichols" was released by Leo Records in February 2012. The "Cadence" reviewer wrote: "With an abundance of complexity, Nabatov is able to sustain his overlapping lines and constantly changing harmonic colors in a way that’s never excessive or showy, and never loses the music." "The Independent" described the performances as "marvellously jangly, madly syncopated vamping where the bones of the originals show through."

Performances of some of the same material were subsequently released on DVD by PanRec.

Mariantonia Samà

Mariantonia Samà (2 March 1875 - 27 May 1953) was an Italian Roman Catholic. Samà lived alone with her mother until 1920 aiding her in domestic duties while coping with their poor state due to her father's death before Samà was born. But drinking unsafe water after working in the fields caused great infirmities and often-violent convulsions that the populace believed her to be possessed. In the town lived a baroness who organized for her to be taken to a Carthusian convent to be exorcised but this failed. Samà was healed after the convent's prior put her in front of a statue of Saint Bruno of Cologne and lived in relative peace for a while before being bedridden with another illness that she never recovered from.

Her mother tended to her until her death in 1920 at which point the populace as well as nuns and Redemptorist priests came to visit her to aid her and provide for her while also seeking her out for advice. Samà was close to the Sisters of the Sacred Heart who placed a black veil upon her head as if she were a nun too.

The beatification process had been called for since her death since the population came to believe she was a saint due to her reputation for personal holiness. The calls for such a process grew in the 2000s to the point where the formal cause was launched in her province. The process culminated on 18 December 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed her heroic virtue and named her as Venerable as a result.

Mariantonia Samà was born on 2 March 1875 as the sole child born to Bruno Samà (d. 20.06.1874) and Marianna Vivino (d. 24.02.1920). Her father had died a few months prior to her birth which left her mother alone to take care of the newborn child. The pair were poor and lived in a small home in a small lane almost five feet wide with dim light. Her baptism was celebrated on 3 March in the local parish. Her paternal grandmother was Antonia Frustaci and her maternal great-uncle was Antonio Vivino (09.10.1824-???). Her maternal grandparents were Giuseppe Vivino and Caterina Carioti. Samà made her First Communion and received her Confirmation in 1882.

The pair fostered a close bond with each other due to the pair living alone and her mother did all she could to provide for herself and her daughter despite their hardships. Samà was docile and obedient to her mother. The two were also illiterate and spoke the local dialect rather than the mainstream Italian language. The pair were also pious and walked barefoot in summer and winter to attend Mass at their church; their clothing was also poor and was minimal more so in wintertime. Samà often accompanied a mule loaded with wheat to the mill and would bring it back to the village with sacks of flour which would be exchanged for a loaf of bread each week.

In 1886 she followed her mother and some relatives to the Saluro River to clean clothing near the mill along the banks. En route home she was in a section of land known as Briga and there decided to quench her thirst so bent to drink from a water puddle she thought was clean (but in all likelihood was contaminated). But when she reached hope she shrunk up and was immobile for about a month. During this period she often babbled incoherent things and often shook and twisted around. It was also strange in the mind of those who knew her condition that she ate past midnight and at no other time. But soon people came to believe that evil spirits had possessed her and so turned to God for a miracle. These attempts failed until the baroness Enrichetta Scoppa decided to intervene in 1894. The baroness organized for the immobile Samà to be taken to a Carthusian convent (that of Serra San Bruno) for an exorcism. The convent's archives revealed a monk's 15 paged narrative dated 1904 and detailing the baroness's plans. In June 1894 she was transported eight hours alongside her mother to the carrier but sealed in a wooden box with four people as her carriers. Samà was enclosed in the wooden box due to her often-violent convulsions. Her transporters were Antonio Mannello and Antonio Frustaci as well as the brothers Vincenzo and Giuseppe Lombardo (who all worked for the baroness). During the trip the box was opened to see if she required something but she declined and grew more and more agitated over time.

Their arrival at the convent was before noon with some of the locals following the procession to the convent where the exorcism rite began in Latin once the procession reached the convent's main gate. The absent convent's prior - who had been elsewhere - joined the crowd and the other monks for five hours turning to God for His grace but nothing happened. To that end the prior ordered a servant to get a silver bust containing the cranium and bones of Saint Bruno of Cologne. Once Samà saw this bust - which she believed was smiling at her - got up and hugged the bust proclaiming her condition to be healed. The crowd were elated that Samà's condition was resolved so the box and her old clothes were burned to the side of the convent to demonstrate a rebirth and renewal.

Samà returned home but in 1896 suffered from arthritis. The condition grew so bad to the point where she confined herself to her bed on her back with her bent knees raised. This would be the position she would remain in for the remainder of her life. Samà was immobile once more but could use her hands to recite rosaries and to eat. Her mother died in 1920 which left her alone until an older woman oversaw her care for a time. But the townsfolk visited her to help care for her. People bought her food and cooked meals as well as oils and fruits to sustain her without causing her pain and intestinal complications. But she was far too modest for the doctor to assess those areas that caused her greater pain and forbade the doctor from doing so. Those supplies she needed she kept for herself but donated the rest of the food supplies to the poor and said of it that "God will take care of me tomorrow!" There were those who offered financial assistance but she refused all attempts at this.

The wall opposite her had a large Crucifix and she would often stare at it and refer to Jesus as "that beautiful Jesus" as the best description possible for Him. The local priest would bring the Eucharist to her each morning as well as each noon and night at her request for she believed it bought her closer to Jesus. People who visited her often recited rosaries with her in Latin and countless others came to see her to ask her for advise. Her response would be to urge courage and hope.

The Sisters of the Sacred Heart - whom the baroness Scoppa had allowed to settle in her vacant palace - made her a "sister" and had a special reverence and love for her. To that end the order covered her head with the order's black veil and she became known as the "Little Sister of Saint Bruno". The nuns too took care of her and helped to both comb and bathe her. The local parish priest and the Redemptorist fathers also visited her and oversaw her spiritual care and guidance. In 1915 she dedicated herself to God through private vows with the permission of the parish priest.

Samà died in the morning on 27 May 1953 while three women were at her bedside reciting litanies to the Blessed Mother; her gaze upon her death was at the Crucifix on the opposite wall and her last words were the names of Jesus and His mother. Upon her death she had no visible bedsores and her skin was both smooth and unblemished. Her remains were dressed in a white linen dress and carried in a procession through the streets in an open casket before their internment following her funeral on 29 May. Upon her death the parish priest wrote in the margins of her death certificate that Samà had "died in the concept of holiness". On 3 August 2003 her remains were relocated from the chapel of the Sisters of the Sacred Heart to a new special tomb constructed in the church of Santi Pietro e Paolo.

The Calabrian episcopate voiced their approval in launching the cause for the canonization for Samà after a favorable vote was taken on 20 April 2007. The diocesan investigation opened in the Catanzaro-Squillace archdiocese on 5 August 2007 and later concluded on 2 March 2009. But the formal introduction to the cause came under Pope Benedict XVI on 29 September 2007 after she was titled as a Servant of God and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued an edict declaring "nihil obstat" (no objections to the cause). But the C.C.S. requested that another investigation into Samà's life be undertaken and the process was opened on 20 October 2011 and was closed a couple of months later on 31 January 2012. The C.C.S. later validated these two processes in Rome on 9 June 2012.

The postulation drafted and later submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. officials on 15 September 2014 for evaluation with nine theologians approving the cause on 21 June 2016 after having assessed the dossier. The cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. approved the cause later on 5 December 2017. Samà became titled as Venerable on 18 December 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that she had lived a model life of heroic virtue.

Her beatification depends upon one miracle receiving papal approval; the miracle needs to be a healing that both science and medicine fail to explain. There was one such case reported in Genoa which led to Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco overseeing a diocesan investigation into the case from 1 November 2008 until 23 October 2009.

The current postulator for the cause is the Capuchin friar Carlo Calloni.

Daivame Kaithozham K. Kumar Akanam

Daivame Kaithozham K. Kumar Akanam is a 2018 Indian Malayalam-language film written and directed by Salim Kumar. It stars Jayaram and Anusree, and also features Salim Kumar, Sreenivasan, Nedumudi Venu, Harisree Ashokan, Anjali Nair, and Pradeep Kottayam. The film revolves around how the lives of K. Krishna Kumar (Jayaram) and his wife Nirmala (Anusree) go for a toss after lord almighty enters their house. This film is credited as 500th film appearance of Nedumudi Venu.

The movie begins with the narration that God (Nedumudi Venu) is planning to visit earth in order to study the humans closely and has sent his personal secretary Mayadathan (Pradeep Kottayam) to enquire about a suitable house for him to stay in. They choose the home of K. Kumar/ Krishna Kumar (Jayaram) to stay for the duration of their visit, as he is the only person on earth who has never troubled god by praying for his needs.

God and Mayadathan arrive in Kerala and arrives at K Kumar's house. They are welcomed with talapoli, chendakott etc by the entire village and starts living at Krishna Kumar's house. 

Next morning they see how life is for Krishna Kumar and his wife Nirmala ￼( Anusree). Kumar is the Panchayath Secretary and spends his time wandering around, while Nirmala spends all her time toiling in the kitchen and doing the household works. Also, Krishna Kumar is a loafer who needs his wife to do everything for him and yet doesn't appreciate it and often finds fault with her. This leads to constant bickering among the couple.

During one such fight, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar challenge each other to exchange their roles to prove whether men or women are stronger. God tries to dissuade them from this attempt and warns them that there would be dire consequences to this game. But both Nirmala and Krishna Kumar are adamant. So God allows them to do as they want.

From the next day, Nirmala goes to work and Krishna Kumar stays at home to do the household works that Nirmala used to do for him. While life is easy for Nirmala, Kumar struggles to cope with the stress of having to manage the home and Kitchen.￼

On a parallel track, the life of Nirmala's cousin Karimannur Gopi ( Salim Kumar) is shown. He lives with his wife, who is very lazy and doesn't want to cook, and his son. He is supposedly a friend of Lionel Messi and has opened a jewellery store in partnership with him.

In Kumar's house, after many days into the role swapping, Nirmala and Krishna Kumar decides to end it (as Nirmala is unable to bear how much Krishna Kumar is suffering) and tells the same to God. But God drops the bombshell by saying that it is impossible to switch the roles back now because to experience the life of a woman completely, Krishna Kumar's will have to get pregnant and give birth to a child. This shatters the couple.

The rest of the film deals with the couple's attempts to outsmart god's plans by adopting different methods to try to abort the child Kumar is carrying.


The music for the film is composed by Nadirsha,

Initially Jayaram and Mamta Mohandas signed into play the lead pair and later Anusree replaced Mamta.

The Emperor of Ocean Park

The Emperor of Ocean Park is a 2002 novel by American author and law professor Stephen L. Carter. The book was Carter's first work of fiction, and spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list following its publication. Described as a murder mystery, the novel tells the story of Talcott Garland, a law professor who uncovers a mystery surrounding his father, the titular 'Emperor of Ocean Park'. Written from Tal's first person perspective, the book explores themes of privileged black identity, politics, and law, and contains many allusions to chess.

Carter received an exceptionally large advance of $4.2 million for the book, with a number of publishing houses interested in obtaining the rights. The size of the advance, for a debut novel from an African-American writer, contributed to an important shift for African-American literature, with the book marketed and received as a mainstream work of fiction, rather than one aimed at a specialized audience. The novel was well-reviewed by most critics, with attention being drawn to its then-unusual setting for a murder mystery story, featuring an African-American protagonist with most of the story being played out in wealthy, predominately African-American neighborhoods in Washington, D.C. and Martha's Vineyard. It won a number of awards, including the 2003 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award, and was nominated for several more, including the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Work, Fiction and the New Blood Dagger from the Crime Writer's Association.

The novel forms the first part of Carter's "Elm Harbor" series; two more novels in the series have been published to date.

Talcott 'Tal' Garland (known as Misha to his closest friends) is a black tenured law professor at Yale University, in New Haven, Connecticut. His wife, Kimberley Madison, known as Kimmer, is an attorney. Tal's father, Oliver Garland, a federal judge, has just died. In life, Judge Oliver Garland's legal career had somewhat stumbled some years earlier, having to decline a nomination from President Ronald Reagan for a seat on the Supreme Court due to the release of embarrassing information about his past, and then resigning from the bench. Following some years of heavy drinking, the latter part of Oliver's life was seemingly spent as a well-paid mascot for right-wing white political groups. Judge Garland dies in suspicious circumstances, purportedly of a heart attack. The death brings together the Judge's three living children – Tal, Addison, and Mariah – for the funeral. A fourth child, Abby, died some years previously, in a hit and run car accident.

Talcott is named in Judge Garland's will as being responsible for the "final arrangements", which are not explained. Talcott's only clue is a cryptic note left for him by his father, reading "Excelsior, my son! Excelsior! It begins!" – a reference to the Double Excelsior; the first of many chess references found within the trail of clues the Judge has left. Unbeknownst to Tal, many years earlier the Judge had hired a private investigator to investigate his daughter's death, and had done so at the suggestion of Jack Ziegler, a college roommate of the Judge's and a figure working in espionage for the CIA, in return for the Judge influencing some legislation to suit Ziegler. This investigator finds the car that killed Abby was being driven by the son of a prominent US senator and his girlfriend, both of whom were subsequently killed in similar car accidents. The release of details of Judge Garland's relationship with Ziegler is what led to the Judge failing to gain a seat on the Supreme Court. Ziegler approaches Talcott at his father's funeral, demanding to know the details of the Judge's final arrangements. In two other interlinking plot threads, Kimmer's campaigning for a highly-sought-after seat on one of the 13 Federal Courts of Appeal, and the state of Talcott and Kimmer's marriage are also addressed. Kimmer, with whom Talcott had previously had an affair while she was married to one of Talcott's fellow law professors, is suggested to be unfaithful, although this is never confirmed.

Talcott discovers parties including the FBI, and an unknown assassin – later revealed as one of Judge Garland's fellow judges – are prepared to kill in order to obtain the details of the arrangements. Talcott follows a series of cryptic clues left by his father to finally find that the arrangements Judge Oliver Garland referred to was in fact a floppy disk containing details of the many trials and legal decisions which the Judge illegally fixed, in return for favors and payment from a number of very prominent people. The disk was hidden in a toy bear which belonged to Abby – Tal's deceased sister. The book ends with Talcott throwing the disk into a fire, to start with a clean slate.

Stephen L. Carter wrote "The Emperor of Ocean Park" while working as a Professor of Law at Yale. In a 2002 interview, Carter, who had already written several non-fiction books in his career, said that the idea for a fiction novel had "always been in the back of [his] mind", and that the major characters of the novel had been ones he had tried to fit into various draft, unpublished stories over the preceding years. Carter wrote most of the book at night, while working at Yale during the day; it took him four years to complete.

Many of the legal and political topics addressed in the book, such as the workings of the FBI, the appointment process for the Supreme Court, and the political lobbying of judges were topics, on which Carter had previously published non-fiction books and writings, making it possible for him to use this knowledge in writing the novel without requiring extensive research. In particular, his scholarly works "The Confirmation Mess", "The Culture of Disbelief", "Civility", and "Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby" were all touchpoints in writing "The Emperor of Ocean Park".

Carter stated his writing for the novel was influenced by James Baldwin, the author of "Go Tell It on the Mountain", and by Langston Hughes, in particular how Hughes wrote dialogue.

Following a fierce bidding war in early 2001 among American publishers Knopf, sister publisher Random House, and others, Carter was given one of the largest advances ever received by a first-time author of fiction from Knopf for the rights to publish the book, of $4.2 million, which included any adaptation rights. The advance also included the rights to Carter's second novel, "New England White", which was released in 2008. With the two publishing houses making bids of equal value, Carter chose Knopf because he remembered the support he had been given from Sonny Mehta, the editor-in-chief of Knopf, who had read a few early draft chapters of the novel in 1998, and encouraged Carter to continue with it. Carter received a further $1 million for the British publishing rights, from Jonathan Cape.

"The Emperor of Ocean Park" was first released in hardcover on June 2, 2002, published in the United States by Knopf. The paperback was released in the US on May 27, 2003.

Upon release in 2002, "The Emperor of Ocean Park" became the first book featured on the Today Show's book club, and was on the cover of "The New York Times" Book Review on June 16. A twelve-city promotional tour, a national print and television advertising campaign took place, and the interest caused by this, along with the positive reviews and media attention, encouraged Knopf to print an additional 250,000 hardcover copies within the first month of the book's release, almost doubling the initial print run of 275,000. "The Emperor of Ocean Park" went immediately to number one on Amazon.com and spent 11 weeks on the "New York Times" best-seller list. Carter said that "the enthusiasm and even affection that has greeted the novel and the characters has overwhelmed me".

An audiobook version, narrated by Richard Allen, was released on July 21, 2003. "The Emperor of Ocean Park" forms part one of Carter's "Elm Harbor" series; the second book ("New England White") was released in 2007, and the third ("Palace Council") in 2008. Neither "New England White" nor "Palace Council" feature Talcott Garland as a character; "New England White" promotes two minor characters from "The Emperor of Ocean Park" – Lemaster and Julia Carlyle – into the main protagonists, and "Palace Council" is set from 1952–1974, with the main character, Eddie Wesley, being related to the Garland family by marriage.

"The Emperor of Ocean Park" was noted by many critics to bring together two themes – the "lowbrow" genre fiction style, in particular using the principles and thematic elements of a pulp thriller or murder mystery, and the "highbrow" literary fiction style, in which Carter reflects on black America – what Carter (as Talcott Garland) refers to as the "darker nation" – from a black perspective. Ocean Park itself is an area of Oak Bluffs, a summer colony on Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Until the 1960s, Oak Bluffs was the only town on Martha's Vineyard that welcomed black tourists, as other towns on the island did not allow black guests to sta in inns and hotels; Carter summers there, and noted the enduring appeal of Martha's Vineyard to African-American families. Racial themes and expository sections on upper-class black culture form a large part of the narrative of "The Emperor of Ocean Park", with the lead character being described as highly self-conscious of his race and how that influences his life.

The novel is "unmistakably a product by a legal academic"; Carter delves into great detail around a number of legal issues throughout the novel, calling upon his legal experience and research. Judge Oliver Garland is described as an amalgam of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; Carter noted that much of the inspiration for Judge Garland's travails during his confirmation hearing were inspired by Carter watching the hearings of Clarence Thomas.

The introductory epigraph ("Two fools always win, but three fools, never!") at the start of the book is a quote attributed by Carter to Siegbert Tarrasch, a chess writer of the late 19th and early 20th century. Chess plays a major part in "The Emperor of Ocean Park"; a member of the United States Chess Federation, Carter included a great number of allegories to chess within the novel, equating white characters with the white pieces, and black characters with the black. Early in the book, two pawns – one white, one black – go missing from the chessboard in Tal's father's study. The book is divided into three main sections, each named after an element of chess theory, again as allegories to the themes within the book; Nowotny Interference, in which two black pieces obstruct one another, Turton Doubling, when one white piece withdraws to enable a second white piece to move in front of it and jointly attack the black king, and Unprovided Flight, where only one move is available to the black king, and checkmate is imminent. The final chapter is entitled "Double Excelsior", in reference to the Excelsior problem, linking back to the Judge's original note for Talcott, and suggesting the one remaining black pawn (Tal) and the last white pawn (Ziegler) had been slowly moving towards one another, to be promoted to knights, with the only apparent ending being for the two pieces to collude, and the only possible result being for the black piece to lose.

In a lengthy author's note at the end of the novel, Carter writes at length to point out that the book was decidedly not a "roman à clef". While superficially, Stephen Carter and Talcott Garland shared a number of characteristics – they were both middle-aged professors of law at Yale, both summered at Martha's Vineyard as part of the wealthy black community there, both were chess fans, both were married to other lawyers, and so on – Carter considered that the resemblance ended there, and Garland was an original literary creation, as were all the other characters. This was gently mocked by some critics.

In an early review, "Publishers Weekly" forecast that "The Emperor of Ocean Park" would bring Carter wide recognition as a novelist. The novel received a broadly positive reception upon release, although some responses were mixed. In a review for the "New York Times", writer Ward Just discussed at length the preoccupation of the book with describing the world of the black bourgeoisie, and suggested that "in Stephen Carter, the black upper class has found its Dreiser" – referring to the influential naturalist author Theodore Dreiser. "The Detroit Free Press" described it as an "expansively, constantly interesting book" and suggested that it would be popular summer reading material. Jelani Cobb, writing for "The Crisis", noted like others that the book features aspects of both genre and literary fiction, and described Carter's attempt to bring the two together as sprawling and sublime. He drew attention to the unusual protagonist, describing the Talcott Garland character as "jaded, overweight, and profoundly insecure".

Novelist Ian Rankin suggeted the book was "very well written but badly constructed", due to the conflation of a number of thriller cliches, and the over-complicated plot obscured a great story. The "AV Club" suggested Carter had a tendency to overwrite, and too often strayed away from a "spellbinding" plot in its exposition. Carter's writing style was noted for being at times dispassionate, and 'chilly', particularly when straying away from the more esoteric topics the novel covers and into the personal, with some of the descriptions (such as that of a young child being "childlike") being criticized. The density of the book was discussed, with some reviewers suggesting that the multitude of references to chess required a certain knowledge of the game in order to appreciate the allusions and clues contained through the book, and others that the writing was at times clunky, and the sidetracking into social commentary detracted from the narrative flow.

Awards:

Nominations: 

As part of the significant advance Carter obtained with Knopf in 2001, Knopf received the rights to any subsequent screen adaptations of "The Emperor of Ocean Park". "Variety" reported that, after reading an early version of the manuscript a number of production companies were interested in acquiring the rights to create a movie adaptation of the novel. In the end, the rights were preemptively optioned by Warner Brothers, John Wells Productions, and Gaylord Films prior to the novel being published. As yet, no adaptation of the novel has entered production. Stephen Schiff completed a script adaptation in 2003 which was attached to director Carl Franklin, and another script was written by novelist and screenwriter Attica Locke in 2009. Actor Wendell Pierce said in early 2015 that a movie adaptation of "The Emperor of Ocean Park" would be his dream project. It was also reported in 2015 that writer Katori Hall was working with John Wells on a television pilot of "The Emperor of Ocean Park" for Fox Network.

Malacidin

Malacidins are a class of chemicals made by bacteria found in soil that can kill Gram-positive bacteria. Their activity appears to be dependent on calcium. The discovery of malacidins was published in 2018. 

The malacidin family were discovered using a new method of soil microbiome screening that does not require cell culturing. This allowed researchers to identify genetic components necessary to produce the chemical. Malacidin A was shown to kill "Staphylococcus aureus" and other Gram-positive bacteria.

At the time of publication it was not certain if the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs, because large investments of time and money are required to determine whether any drug is safe and effective.

Malacidins are macrocycle lipopeptides. The 2018 paper described two chemicals in the malacidin family, differing only by a methylene at their lipid tails. Their peptide cores include four non-proteinogenic amino acids. The name "malacidin" is derived from the abbreviation of "metagenomic acidic lipopeptide antibiotic" and the suffix "-cidin".

Malacidins appear to take on their active conformation after they bind to calcium; the calcium-bound molecule then appears to bind to lipid II, a bacterial cell wall precursor molecule, leading to destruction of the cell wall and death of the bacteria. Therefore, they would be a new member of the class of calcium-dependent antibiotics. The discovery of malacidins supported the view that the calcium-dependent antibiotics are a larger class than previously thought.

Malacidins were discovered by researchers at Rockefeller University, led by Brad Hover and Sean Brady. The group had been looking into antibiotics related to daptomycin and their calcium-dependent nature, but determined that it would be impractical to culture variations in lab conditions. Instead, the team used a genetics approach that was more scalable. They focused on searching for novel biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) – genes that are usually expressed together, that bacteria use to make secondary metabolites. To do this, they extracted DNA from around 2,000 soil samples to build metagenomic libraries that captured the genetic diversity of the environmental microbiome. They then designed degenerate primers to amplify genes likely to be similar to the BGC that make daptomycin by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, sequenced the amplified genes, and then used metagenomics to confirm that these genes were indeed likely to be the kind of BGCs they sought. One of the novel BGCs they found was present in around 19% of the screened soil samples but not readily found in cultured microbial collections, so they took that BGC, put it into other host bacteria, and then isolated and analyzed the secondary metabolites. The work was published in "Nature Microbiology" in February 2018.

The approach of screening the soil for useful compounds using genomics has been done by others, and is likely to continue to be pursued as a method to further explore primary metabolites and secondary metabolites made by microrganisms.

, the malacidins had not been tested on humans. At the time of their discovery it was unknown whether the discovery would lead to any new antibiotic drugs; showing that a potential drug is safe and effective takes years of work and millions of dollars, and the scientists said at the time that they had no plans to try to develop a drug based on the work. In the 2018 paper, malacidins were shown to kill only Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria. They were, however, able to kill multidrug-resistant pathogens, including bacteria resistant to vancomycin in the laboratory, and methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus" (MRSA) skin infections in an animal wound model.

Brady, Hover, and two other authors disclosed in the 2018 paper that they had "competing financial interests, as they are employees or consultants of Lodo Therapeutics." Lodo was founded in 2016 out of Brady's laboratory, to discover new chemicals in nature as starting points for drug discovery.

Maskoskanaw River

Maskoskanaw River is a tributary of Frontenac Lake (Milieu River), flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, in the Regional County Municipality (MRC) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada.

The Maskoskanaw River flows successively into the townships of Huard and Buade. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.

The forest road R0212 (East-West direction) cuts the middle of the course of the Milieu River (Normandin River). The route 451 linking La Tuque to Obedjiwan, Quebec passes south of Patterson Lake; several secondary road branches serving the surroundings of this head lake.

The surface of the Maskoskanaw River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

The toponym "Maskoskanaw River" was formalized on September 6, 1984 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec..

Auguste Hubert Warnier (8 January 1810 – 15 March 1875) was a French medical doctor, journalist and politician who spent most of his career in Algeria.
At first he was a Saint-Simonian and was sympathetic to the local population.
He thought the Berbers had Germanic blood and a civilization derived from Roman and Christian origins, so could readily adapt to French civilization.
He had no respect for the Arab "intruders".
Later he took the view that the indigenous people had destroyed the once-fertile environment of Algeria, became a proponent of French colonization and opposed the "Arab Kingdom" policy of Napoleon III.
In his last years he was a Representative in the National Assembly for the Province of Algiers.
He was responsible for a law that allowed expropriation of land or forced sale to colonists.

Auguste Hubert Warnier was born on 8 January 1810 in Rocroi, Ardennes.
His parents were Jean-Louis Warnier (1774–1814), Lieutenant in the 6th line regiment and Knight of the Legion of Honour, and Marie Salomé Victoire Seguin (c. 1789–1849).
He received a classical education in Reims.
He studied medicine in Paris.
After passing his medical examinations he was in turn attached to the Val-de-Grâce military hospital in Paris and the military hospital in Lille.
By 1931 he was a military doctor.
He was named assistant surgeon in Douai in 1832.

Warnier was sent to Oran during the cholera outbreak of 1834.
In Algeria he studied the customs and language of the Arabs while serving with the ambulances of the Army of Africa.
In 1835 he was cited for his role in the fighting at Mostaganem for having recovered, alone, a dying soldier from the field of battle.
Warnier joined the Service des Affaires Arabes in 1837 and served in Mascara until 1839 treating the indigenous people and fighting cholera.
In the process he gained a solid understanding of Arab society.
Warnier served with the consul Eugène Daumas in Mascara, and Daumas wrote to his commanding officer in Oran saying he was a congenial and talented assistant.
He was praised for his medical skill, his humanity and his knowledge of Algeria and its peoples.
In 1838 he was a member of the mission sent to the Emir Abdelkader after the Treaty of Tafna.
In 1939 he completed his medical studies and received a doctorate in medicine from the University of Montpellier.

Warnier and Joanny André Napoléon Perier were the two physicians on the Scientific Commission for the Exploration of Algeria, which operated from 1840 to 1842 and resulted in the publication of 39 volumes on a range of subjects.
Warnier met the Saint-Simonian leader Prosper Enfantin, whom he befriended, and became one of Enfantin's most faithful collaborators.
As a Saint-Simonian he earned hostility from some quarters, praise from others.
In 1843 Warnier represented the government to prisoners captured at the Battle of the Smala.
He was attached to the maritime expedition to Morocco in 1844, and sent almost daily reports to Enfantin who published them in his newspaper "Algeria".
He was in charge of negotiating the Treaty of Tangiers (1844).
He was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour on 17 October 1844.
He was then director of civil affairs in Oran.
In an official publication in 1847 Warnier and Ernest Carette wrote positively about the nomads, although later Warnier would support colonialism.
Warnier considered that the local people formed three groups: 1 million were Berbers who spoke the Berber language.
1.2 million were Arab-speaking Berbers and 500,000 were pure Arabs or other minorities such as Turks and Moors.
Daumas was among those who thought the Kabyle people, the largest Berber group, were partly Germanic in origin, had formerly been Christians and had not been fully converted to Islam. 
In an 1865 book Warnier extended this theory to cover all Berbers.
The cross-like tattoos on the faces of many Kabyles was taken as evidence.
Warnier believed that the Berber civilization had evolved from Roman and Christian traditions, and the Berber speakers, in particular, had escaped the pernicious influence of the Arabs and could adapt to French civilization.
The Arab intruders, in his view, had never established anything of value and would remain alien nomads.

During the French Second Republic Warnier was a member of the council of the government of Algeria in 1848–49.
He returned to private life, and in 1850 founded the "Atlas" newspaper.
This was suppressed after the coup d'état of 2 December 1951.
Warnier was one of the last companions of Père Enfantin, and stayed as a colonist in the Sahel of Algiers Province.
During the Second French Empire Warnier created a large agricultural establishment on the banks of the old Lake Alloula.

For many years Warnier was a strong supporter of projects to open up the Sahara.
He helped Henri Duveyrier, son of one of his and Enfantin's friends.
Duveyrier was Warnier's guest in 1857 at his home in Kandouri, a suburb of Algiers, where he met Oscar MacCarthy.
On 8 March 1857 Duveyrier and MacCarthy left on a five-week trip to Laghouat and back.
Duveyrier was fascinated by the Tuaregs he met on this trip and the next year gave an account of Tuareg customs to the Berlin Oriental Society.
Later Duveyrier made an unsuccessful attempt to reach Tuat, which was stopped by the Tuaregs at El Goléa.
Duveyrier left in May 1859 and after an exhausting journey returned to Warnier's house on 5 December 1861, emaciated and delirious with fever.

By the early 1860s Warnier was no longer associated with the army or the Saint-Simonians, but had became a spokesman for the "colons".
He had retired from the army in 1861.
His "L'Algérie devant le Sénat" (1863), a collection of his articles from "L'Opinion Nationale", laid out the principles for colonization of Algeria by civilian settlers.
It was widely read in France, and was followed by several other books along the same lines.
In 1862 he was the doctor and confidant of Sheikh Othman during his trip to France.
Sheikh Othman was leader of the religious Iforas tribe of the Kel Ajjer and had been Duveyrier's host in 1859.
Warnier gained great prestige among the settlers since he and Jules Duval in Paris were leaders of a group opposed to the emperor's Arab Kingdom policy.
In 1869 Warnier and Jules Duval wrote that, "In their rebellions against our authority, the indigènes are able to distinguish between the "colon" and the solder." 
They said the government downplayed this fact since it would undermine the justification for the "exceptional" military regime.
Warner tried to fight the government in Algeria and published several brochures on the subject.
Warnier was skeptical about Napoleon's 1865 "sénatus-consulte" that defined conditions for native Algerians to become French citizens.
He wrote in 1865,
Warnier thought the imperial government was sacrificing the interests of the French settlers in favour of the Arab aristocracy, which wanted to prevent progress and maintain their feudal control.
He provided proof, based on crop production and taxes paid, that one settler was worth ten indigenous people.
In 1865 Warnier blamed the nomads for destroying the Algerian environment, writing that the land was "long ago a sort of terrestrial paradise ... today this land is a sterile desert."

After the fall of the empire, on 5 September 1870 Warnier became Prefect of Algiers.
He resigned from this position to run as candidate for the National Assembly in Algiers on 17 February 1871, but was defeated.
Warnier ran again in the same department on 9 July 1871 after the resignation of Joseph Garibaldi and this time was elected.
He was also a General counselor of the province of Algiers from August 1870.
In the Assembly he sat with the left, voted against the bishops' petition, against the resignation of Adolphe Thiers, against the septennate and against the ministry of Albert, 4th duc de Broglie.

The government of the French Third Republic reversed the policy of Napoleon III and gave strong support to the French colonists in Algeria.
The Algerian revolt of 1871–72 was crushed and the Algerians were subsequently repressed.
Warnier used the narrative of destruction of the environment by the local people to justify the 1873 settlers' property law that took his name.
The ""Loi Warnier"" accelerated the alienation of the peasantry of Algeria from their lands.
Islamic Law no longer applied to landholdings.
The law facilitated forced purchase or confiscation of land by the colonists.
While deputy, Warnier introduced Hippolyte Mircher to the future explorer of French Africa Paul Soleillet.
Warnier also introduced Soleillet to Léon Cremieux, president of the Israelite Alliance of Algeria, who had obtained French citizenship for Algerian Jews.

Auguste Warnier died in office on 15 March 1875 in Versailles, Yvelines.
The fungus "Lenzites warnieri" is named after him.
It was found growing on the trunks of elms in Warnier's Kandouri property.

Josefina Samper

Josefina Samper Rojas (8 May 1927 – 13 February 2018) was a Spanish syndicalist and feminist, member of the Communist Party of Spain and spouse of Marcelino Camacho.

Born in Fondón on 8 May 1927, when she was 3 years old her father, a miner, emigrated to Oran, Algeria, joining the rest of her family a year later. There, Josefina took care of her sister while her mother worked washing clothes in the houses. Later, Josefina went to work as a trouser dresser in a clothing workshop. At age 12 she started militancy in the Unified Socialist Youth, and at 14 she joined the PCE at the hands of Roberto Carrillo, brother of Santiago Carrillo.

As a party activist, Josefina participated in the distribution of the "España Popular" publications. She also organized the children of the neighborhood to warn using cans as a drum every time the police arrived in search of the hidden Republicans. She also created a kind of cooperative dedicated to the manufacture of raffia shoes with which she helped to maintain her house, as well as that of many other families, mostly of political emigrants. Josefina was responsible for getting the raffia. The benefits were divided according to the pairs of shoes they made, with Josefina obtaining the lowest profits.

Soon, together with other women, she formed a support group for immigrants and political refugees, which, in 1944, led her to receive, on behalf of the party, the task of organizing an aperitif for three prisoners fled from the concentration camp. That is how she met Marcelino Camacho, with whom she married on December 22, 1948 and who had two children, Yenia and Marcel. In 1957, after the pardon of Marcelino, they returned from exile, moving to the neighborhood of Carabanchel, in Madrid, in a modest apartment where they lived until, already in 2010, Marcelino's health forced them to move to another floor in Majadahonda. In his neighborhood of Carabanchel both continued their clandestine political and trade union activity that led to the successive imprisonment of Marcelino. It was then that Josefina and other women, some wives of prisoners and others simply Communist women, mobilized, creating in 1965 the Women's Democratic Movement, germen of the current feminist movement, dedicated to fighting, inside and outside of Spain, to help political prisoners, achieving certain improvements in the conditions in which they were confined. During these years, Josefina gave up looking for a job outside the home, because she needed to dedicate all her time to the cause, so her children, Yenia and Marcel, took responsibility for taking the salary to the family home, while Josefina spent the little time she had to sew pants for a tailor shop and knit sweaters for a wool store.

On November 25, 1975, King Juan Carlos I granted a pardon to the prisoners who had been imprisoned by the , including Marcelino Camacho. Thus began a new life outside the clandestine life that allowed them to rekindle the political and union struggle that Josefina still maintained a few years after the death of Marcelino.

After the death of Marcelino Camacho on 29 October 2010, Josefina maintained a great activity as a transmitter of the memory and voice of her husband, offering frequent talks throughout Spain, helping to inspire the struggle for workers' rights to the new generations. She died on 13 February 2018.

Metropolitan Trails

Metropolitan Trails are urban and suburban hiking trails. As defined by French NGO "Sentiers Métropolitains", they encourage walkers to discover a metropolitan territory, in several days of hiking.

The first official metropolitan trail was the GR2013, a GR footpath around Marseille, launched for Marseille-Provence 2013 European event.

Besides GR2013, other metropolitan trails have been designed; like "Inspiral London", "Iki Deniz Arası” ("Between Two Seas") in Istanbul, "Parcours Métropolitain du Grand Lyon", "Sentier de Randonnée Périurbaine" in Bordeaux, or "Sentieri Metropolitani Milano".

Marseille-based not-for-profit organization "Sentiers Métropolitains" is in charge of the coordination of many trails, including Marseilles, Paris and Avignon. As explained on their website, the design of metropolitan trails takes its roots in hiking, culture, urbanism and art.

Nakayama Shinnosuke

Nakayama Shinnosuke (中山 眞之亮, June 19, 1866 – December 31, 1914) was the first Shinbashira of Tenrikyo. He was the grandson of Nakayama Miki, the foundress of Tenrikyo.

According to Tenrikyo tradition, Nakayama Miki named Shinnosuke and designated him the Shinbashira while he was still in the womb. He was born to parents Kajimoto Sojiro and Haru in the second year of the Japanese era Keiō, on the seventh day of the fifth month, which corresponds to June 19, 1866 in the Gregorian calendar. Shinnosuke was raised in the Kajimoto household in Ichinomoto Village until 1880, when Shinnosuke began to reside at the Nakayama household. Shinnosuke was officially adopted into the Nakayama family on September 23, 1881, and became the family's legal successor on September 22, 1882.

In 1896, Shinnosuke wrote the "Oyasama gyoden" ("The Biography of Oyasama"), the text on which Tenrikyo Church Headquarters' official biography of Nakayama Miki, "The Life of Oyasama", would be based.

John Lyth

John Lyth, D. D. (13 March 1821 – 13 March 1886) was an English Wesleyan Methodist preacher, author, historian and hymn writer. He was the earliest Wesleyan missionary in Germany.

Lyth was born on 13 March 1821 in York. He attended Mr. Heigham's Academy in Doncaster, and began work as a preacher in 1843. In 1859 he became the first Wesleyan missionary in Germany, serving as the General Superintendent of the Wesleyan Community from 1859 to 1865. Lyth retired from the ministry in 1883, and died on 13 March 1886.

Lyth contributed to four major prose publications during his lifetime. In 1843, he published the "History of Methodism in York". This is considered his main work of prose, despite his later release of "Glimpses in Early Methodism in York" in 1885. "Glimpses of Methodism in York" covers from the introduction of Methodism in 1729 up to the date of publication. Upon his mother's death in 1860, Lyth compiled and published "The Blessedness of Religion In Earnest: A Memorial of Mrs. Mary Lyth, of York." Published in 1861 and constructed mainly from Mary's journal entries, Lyth created this memorial because he felt "an example of 'Religion in Earnest,' so pre-eminent, should not pass unrecorded and unimproved."

Half a decade later, Lyth published "The Homiletical Treasury; or, Scripture Analytically Arranged." Originally intended to encompass the entire Bible, "The Homiletical Treasury" only covers Isaiah (published in 1867) and the Epistles from Romans to Philippians (published 1869). At the date of publication, the "London Quarterly Review" "[commended] the work, and [trusted] that Mr. Lyth [would] be encouraged to continue his labors," and his work was cited often in an 1884 homiletical commentary. Charles Spurgeon, however, found "Homiletical Treasury" to be incomplete and surface.

Lyth also wrote a few hymns. "There Is a Better World, They Say" is a hymn originally written for an infant school in Randwick. Lyth said "that it was written for infant children will explain the simplicity of some of the expressions." Lyth claimed this hymn was based on an earlier piece and dates its writing as 30 April 1845. It was written to the tune of "All is Well," and first appeared in the "Home and School Hymn Book". He also wrote "We Won't Give Up the Sabbath," which was included in the "Methodist Sunday School Hymn Book" in 1879. Both hymns are imitations of older works. "Wild Flowers; or, a Selection of Original Poetry, edited by J. L." was compiled and published in 1843. All of the poems Lyth included were written by himself, a family member, or Dr. Punshon.

Flag of the Organization of American States

The Flag of the Organization of American States is one of the official symbols of the Organization of American States (OAS).
It was adopted in 1965 and has been amended several times as new members have joined the OAS. The flag of the Organization of American States was used for the first time during the administration of Secretary General Jose Antonio Mora. The flag consists of the seal of the Organization, which represents the flags of all the Member States, on a royal blue background. This stamp with the flags is seen for the first time on memorandum paper in the twenties, during the General Direction of Mr. Leo S. Rowe. The flag was ordered to the company Annin & Co., of New York, in April of 1961. The color of the fund that was chosen was real blue that was neither light blue, nor dark blue. In the center are the flags of all the member countries placed in a circular shape, with ten masts at the bottom and framed by a circle. The design was updated for the last time in 1991 when Belize and Guyana joined the Organization of American States. Each time a new Member State enters, its flag is incorporated into the design. The use of the flag has been established in accordance with the traditions and customs in exercise throughout the years in the Organization.

Its design consists of a rectangle of blue background with a white circle, bordered in gold, in its center. Inserted in this circle is the organization shell consisting of a grouping of flags of all member states, which are currently 35, hoisted in mast in gold color. The order of the flags is given in alphabetical order in the Spanish language, starting with Antigua and Barbuda in the lower left, following clockwise until Venezuela in the lower right.

San Pietro a Varlungo, Florence

San Pietro a Varlungo () is Roman Catholic church located on via di Varlungo in Florence, Italy. It was located outside of the former late-medieval walls of Florence.

A church at the site has a long history, and tradition holds that Charlemagne stayed at this site. Documents from the beginning of the 12th century document the church. The early patronage of the structure was by the Bonciani family, but in the 17th century it underwent reconstruction. In the 19th century, the belltower was erected and the facade portico was eliminated. 

During the Second World War, the parish arranged sanctuary to persecuted Jews from Florence. The parish leaders, Leto Casini and Giovanni Simioni are recognized as meriting the honorific title of Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem.

The narrow interior nave contains notable works of art dating to the 17th century refurbishment, including a fresco (1699) by Alessandro Gherardini; a "Glory of St Jospth" and a "Baptism of Christ" by Onorio Marinari; and a barrel-vaulted ceiling fresco depicts "St Peter in Glory with Faith, Hope, an Charity" by Baldassarre Franceschini called "il Volterrano". The ciborium, made of pietra serena, was sculpted in the 15th century.

In the transept is housed a 13th century tempera on wood painting depicting the "Madonna and Child" by the artist called the Master of Varlungo, a putative pupil of Cimabue. The adjacent oratory has a venerated wooden crucifix and in the canonry there is a tabernacle by Guarlone. On the street is a tabernacle from the school of Ghirlandaio depicting the "Virgin and St John the Evangelist".

The Master of Varlungo was an Italian painter active in a Gothic style around Florence between 1285 and 1310.

No documentation exists about the painter; his name is attached to pictures dating from the last two decades of the thirteenth century. His central work is a fragmentary "Madonna and Child" still located in the church of San Pietro a Varlungo, Florence. On a stylistic basis, he was assigned by Roberto Longhi in 1948 as a principal pupil of Cimabue, and as influenced by Giotto. A panel at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, depicting a "Madonna and Child Enthroned with Angels" has been attributed to this painter.

The finest craftsmen of the time, including Jean-Henri Riesener, Georges Jacob, Martin Carlin, and Jean-François Leleu were engaged to design and make her furniture.

With the death of Louis XV on May 10, 1774, his grandson Louis XVI, age twenty became King. The new King had little interest in the arts, but his wife, Marie-Antoinette, and her brothers-in-law, the Comte de Provence (the future Louis XVIII) and the Comte d'Artois {the future Charles X]] were deeply interested in the arts, gave their protection to artists, and ordered large amounts of furniture in the neoclassical style, inspired by Greco-Roman art. They were followed by the wealthy nobles who furnished their chateaux and Paris town houses in the new style. 

The transition from the baroque and the rocaille style to the neoclassical style had begun in about 1760, near the end of the reign of Louis XV. It was advanced by the reports of the discoveries at the archeological sites at Herculaneum and Pompeii. Madame de Pompadour, Mistress of Louis XV, had dispatched a group of scholars to Italy to report on the findings. The group included the designer Jean-Charles Delafosse and the Flemish architect, sculptor and engraver Jean-François de Nefforge. Their engravings of Greek and Roman art inspired many furniture designers and particularly the "ebenistes", who made the fine marquetry inlaid ornament that decorated chests and tables. 

Marie-Antoinette was a promoter of the new style even before she became queen. In 1770, after her marriage to the Dauphin Louis, she took over the apartments of the former Queen, Marie Leczinska, who had died in 1768. In 1779 she commissioned the architect Richard Mique to completely redo the cabinet of the Queen. He covered the walls with white satin embroidered with flowers, arabesques and medallions. In 1783 she decided to renew the decor once again, this time with wood panels sculpted and painted white, decorated with gilded neoclassical frames and designs, including sphinxes and tripods,given lightness by bouquets of flowers. The fireplace, made of dark red stone, was ornamented with gilded bronze caryatides. The furniture for the room was made by Jean Henri Riesener, and included a commode, a corner table and a secretary inlaid with cedar wood, amarante, and medallions of gilded bronze. It also included a sofa with a gilded frame placed in a niche surrounded by mirrors, and facing the window. This room, with its combination of comfort, intimacy and luxury, is among the most classic examples Louis XVI style. It has been restored to its original appearance, while some of the original furniture is now in the Wallace Collection in London. 

Another notable influence to the style was the work of the British designer Robert Adam, particularly in the design of chairs, and in the use of mahogany wood, which was quickly adapted in France. 

A majority of the top "ébénists" were German or of German descent, which gave them a common language with Marie-Antoinette. The most prominent figures under Louis XVI were Jean Henri Riesener, who received the title of ebeniste Ordinaire of the royal household in 1774. His main rival was Jean-François Leleu, one of the few who was not German. Other ebenistes, including Martin Carlin and Adam Weisweiler worked primarily for furniture merchants who supplied the wealthy Parisian upper class. They developed a new genre, decorating furniture with plaques of Sevres porcelain or lacquered wood panels. The ebeniste David Roentgen kept his workshop in Germany, though many of his clients were in Paris. He became particularly famous for his elaborate desks, which frequently mechanical folding features. 

The French Revolution caused the dispersal of the royal furniture; most of the owners went to the guillotine, or fled into exile. Their furniture confiscated and was sold by the successive governments in enormous lots, with the proceeds helping the finance the long wars of the period. The furnishings of the Palace of Versaille was auctioned off between Sunday, August 25, 1793 until 11 August 1794, and were widely scattered. Many of the buyers were British, and some of the finest items went to the British royal family and to the Wallace Collection. In the 19th century, many of the pieces of furniture migrated again, sold by British aristocrats to wealthy Americans. Extensive collections are found today in the Museum of Decorative Arts and Louvre in Paris; the Wallace Collection and Victoria and Albert Museum in London; the Metropolitan Museum in New York; and the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.

The fine furniture of the period was made by craftsmen who belonged to guilds or corporations which strictly regulated the work of their members, as well as the access to the profession. The reform-minded prime minister of Louis XVI, Turgot, attempted to suppress the power of the corporations in 1776, but, meeting fierce resistance from the artisans, he withdrew his reforms, and then, a few months later, was forced to resign himself.

The work of making furniture was strictly divided into several crafts: 

In addition to the craftsmen, there were the "marchands-merciers", the merchants who met with clients, took the orders and commissioned the work, and the "ornementistes", gradually becoming known as "décorateurs", who designed the furniture.

An "estampille" or stamp of the craftsmen, was required on the finished work. The menuisiers made the stamp of their name or initials on the on the bottom of chairs, while the ébénistes put their names under the crossbeam of bureaus or under the marble tops of consoles. Many of the marks today are difficult to read, and counterfeit marks were not unknown, since they could greatly increase the value of the furniture. 

The body of the furniture, the part crafted by "menuisiers", was usually made of woods found in France. Cherry wood and walnut were often used, especially in regional furniture. Beech was commonly used for chairs, since it was sold, easily sculpted, and could be easily gilded and painted. Oak was rarely used, because it was hard and difficult to carve. It was usually reserved for frames and mountings.

The decorative woods for "marquetry" were termed "Bois des Indes" and usually came from South America or the West Indies. They were often named by their color rather than botanical name; "bois de rose", "bois de violette", and "bois d,amaranthe". The late Louis XVI period, and a passion for things English, brought an enthusiasm for mahogany. 

The chairs of the Louis XV period were characterized by elegance, lightness and simplicity of form. The most notable craftsmen of chairs were Georges Jacob, furnisher to the Royal "Garde-Meuble", or furniture depot, from 1774, and Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené who obtained the title of official "fourniseur" in 1785.

The basic types of chairs were little changed from the Louis XV style, but a wider variety of forms appeared, particularly in the "dossier", or back, of the armchairs. These included "en raquette", "en chapeau", "en lyre", "en grebe", "en anse de pannier", and, the most popular, "en médaillon". Another popular variation of "dossier" was the "à chapeau du gendarme", or "policeman's hat". The most classical elements of the chairs were the legs; they were usually carved like Roman or Greek columns tapering to the end, a style called "effilés". The decoration of upholstery, following the taste of Marie-Antoinette, and to match the decoration on the walls, was usually floral, 

The "chaise voyeuse", a type invented under Louis XV, remained popular, It featured an armrest on the top, was designed so the person sitting could sit astride with his arms on the top of the chair back, for playing cards. A set of four of these chairs was made by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené for Madame Elizabeth, sister of Marie-Antoinette, and was delivered in 1789, the year of the beginning of the French Revolution.

Another original type that appeared under Louis XVI was the "Fauteul de Bureau", or office chair. A set was made by Henri Jacob, brother of Georges Jacob, in about 1785, made of carved walnut, cane and lester. The seat was mounted on a circular platform, and could turn around, the first recorded swivel chair. In 1790 Henri Jacob produced a series of drawings of fanciful "Etruscan" furniture, inspired by a British movement and anticipating the wave of neoclassicism of the French Directory. 

The console table, which had first appeared under Louis XV, was designed to be against or attached to the wall, and was often made by the same "menuisiers" who created the wooden wall panelling. It was decorated only on the front and sides. The top was made of marble or other stone, and was either rectangular of half-moon shaped. It usual had four feet, joined together an X-shaped or H-shaped brace for stability. The central point of the brace under the console often had a pedestal, where pieces of fine porcelain could be displayed. Some smaller consoles had only a single foot, decorated with carved garlands of flowers. 

Unlike the highly-ornamented consoles of Louis XV furniture, with twisting rocaille sculpture, Louis XVI consoles, particularly in the late years, had an elegant simplicity. They included small varieties, such as the "Console-Desserte", half-moon shaped, with a white marble and a simple wooden platform below supporting the legs, it was made of oak and mahogany, with slender tapering straight legs, with small drawers, discreet gilded bronze ornament, and a delicate ring of gilded bronze around the top. Other small consoles featured discreet marquetry of ebony, rosewood, tinted beech, and ash wood. 

A variety of smaller, more portable tables, also appeared, made either by "menuisiers" of sculpted wood or by "ébénistes" with inlaid marquetry of exotic woods and materials. These included tables for playing cards, tables for writing, and "tables de toilette", or dressing tables, which were usually of a simple form covered with fabric with embroidered designs or with lace. 

During the late reign of Louis XVI, between 1780 and 1790, the British custom of having a round dining room table permanently positioned in the center of a dining room, gradually took hold in France. These tables often had casters on the legs, so they could be moved more easily, and had an extra two legs in the center, so additional sections could be added to enlarge the table. 

Another type of table adapted from the British model was the guéridon, a small round table on a single column, with a base of three legs, often with small wheels or "roulettes". The German-born "ebeniste" David Roentgen made a small oval table with drawers that folded out in around 1780, It was crafted of oak, rosewood, sycamore, boxwood and ebony, ornamented with guilder bronze and extremely fine marquetry in delicate floral patterns made of different colored woods. There were also tables for the popular salon game of trictrac, as well as small writing tables, which sometimes had surfaces decorated with marquetry images of envelopes, pens, and books.
Another new type of small table was the "Bonheur-du-jour", usually used as a dressing table. It had long legs, a semi-circular parquet platform, a drawer, and several small compartments and drawers on top. An oval shelf supported the legs. and oval tray supporting the legs. 

The commode was the grand showcase of the marquetry skills of the "ébénistes" A new form of commode appeared, called "a la greque", which was cubic in form, with very short gilded bronze feet, and a face covered with inlaid decoration in geometric patterns of rosewood, amaranth, boxwood, and ebony, sometimes in a pattern of cubes, or a checkerboard, or the "batons romp" or broken stick pattern. Neoclassic themes appeared especially in the gilded bronze decoration; it commonly featured gilded bronze masks of Apollo or Mercury, gilded bronze drawer handles in the form of garlands of leaves or drapery, and a frieze in a geometric pattern around the top. Another popular form late in the period was a chest decorated with plaques of Sevres porcelain, usually with floral patterns. These were a specialty of the designer Martin Carlin. A more exotic material appeared in a cabinet for medals made for Louis XVI in 1788. The drawers were decorated with gilding and with real feathers and insect wings waxed and applied to the surface..

The marquetry decoration of commodes usually featured trophies or designs representing of love or music, flowers, and sometimes, in the passion for exotic themes, Chinese or Japanese objects. They began to have panels attached which were varnished to appear like Japanese lacquer.

The "Mueble d'appui" was a type of commode with doors on the front, which, like commodes, had a marble top and a highly decorated face, and was designed to display decorative objects, either porcelain or candlesticks or clocks. Some variations had a central cupboard with a door, and shelves on either side for displaying vases or other objects. The commodes at the end of the reign often had friezes of stylized palm leaves abad other vegetal designs.

Later in the reign, A new variant was the commode "a vantaux", where the drawers or shelves nside the cabinet were concealed with two doors. The "ébéniste" Jean-François Leleu went even further and designed a commode with no legs, which was simply placed on a wooden base, the version that became common in the 19th century. Later commodes often took a half-moon form, and had less decoration and ornament; their beauty came from the quality of the mahogany employed for the facing. 

Some other specialized cabinets appeared under Louis XVI, thanks to the improved technology for making larger panes of glass. These included "bibliotheques" or bookcases with glass doors, and "Vitrines", or cabinets with glass doors, where precious objects could be displayed. These had very ornate marquetry patterns on the doors in the earlier years of the reign, but became much simpler, with mahogany and oak trimmed with gilded bronze, in the later years. 

The basic forms of writing table, the drop-front desk and cylinder desk had all appeared in the furniture of Louis XV, but their appearance became more classical, geometric and sober under Louis XVI, and the quality marquetry inlays became much finer. The writing tables varied in size, but had leather tops, tapering legs, and usually three drawers. The corners were often decorated with gilded brass rosettes or other ornaments. The woods used were generally oak, rosewood and amaranth, sometimes with additional mahogany, boxwood and ebody inlays. Some writing tables had additional shelves that could be pulled out for writing surfaces, and some models and a surface that would lift up at an angle. The "bureau à cylinder", or roll top desk, had been invented by Oeben for Louis XV in 1760. The updated versions by Jean-Henri Riesener, were made of oak covered with mahogany, and had simple but elegant gilded bronze drawer handles, keyholes, and a lacy decorative trim fence around the top.

The "Secretaire an armoire" was a vertical piece of furniture which resembled an armoire. The writing surface was pulled down, and the shelves and drawers inside were reveaed. The "Secretaire en cabinet" also had a writing surface that pulled down, with shelves on either side and drawers beneath. Clocks and other decorative objects could be placed on the marge shelf on top. 

The designers who were most celebrated for desks included, besides Jean-Henri Riesener, Jean-Francois Leleu; Claude-Charles Saunier, and particularly David Roentgen, who made desks not only for Louis XVI, but also for Catherine the Great, the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Austria. His desks were famous for the mechanical mechanisms and secret compartments rather than their elegance. 
In the reign of Louis XVIII, nobles often received visitors while in bed. The official waking-up of the King was a formal ceremony, could be attended by anyone in the palace. and nobles often received visitors while they were in bed. In the bedchambers of the King and Queen, the bed was behind a balustrade, and a row of stools was placed behind the balustrade for guests. 

The beds of the nobility and wealthy were usually square or rectangular, with four high posts supporting a canopy called the "ciel", or sky. The "ciel" could either be fixed to the bedposts, or to the wall. Curtains were usually hung from the "ciel" and could be drawn to enclose the bed. In the 18th century different variants of the canopy appeared. In a bed "a la Duchesse" the canopy covered the entire bed, while in a bed "a l'ange", or "like an angel", the canopy covered only the head of the bed. The head of the bed, with its ornate "chevet" or headboard, was usually placed against the wall. 

Several other variants appeared in the 18th century, including the "lit en chair à prêcher", which had a canopy attached to the wall by sloping poles, which resembled the pulpit attached to the wall of a church. A more casual variant, the "lit de jour" or day bed, was midway between a bed and a sofa, with an upholstered chevet or headboard at one end attached to a long cushion with six legs. 

The "Lit à la Polonaise", with the cidl suspended directly over the bed, had first appeared under Louis XV, but was simplified and given a classical look under Louis XVI. Marie Antoinette had a version made for the bath of her apartments in Versailles.

Kokomini

The Kokomini were an indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland.

The Kokomini are estimated by Norman Tindale to have had tribal grounds stretching over about along the middle Palmer and Mitchell rivers, extending westwards to the area where the two meet. Their eastern limits were around Mount Mulgrave and Palmerville.

The Kokomini were said to have used a concoction drawn from Darwin stringybark leaves as a remedy for fever.

Kokomini territory was occupied by white settlers in 1874. Conflicts ensued as the Kokomini speared livestock introduced for grazing on their land, resulting in war between the two. The war was still ongoing a decade later, with the rule established that the indigenous Kokokmini had no right to be "let in" to their land, and a good many were shot down, putatively in "retaliation" for the loss of cattle and horses. The Queensland politician Edward Palmer ran a station in the area in the 1880s.

Katrín Magnússon

Katrín Sigríður Skúladóttir Magnússon (1858–1932) was an early Icelandic feminist who played an important part in promoting women's voting rights and women's education in the late 19th century. She served as a municipal councillor of Reykjavik from 1908 to 1916.

Born on 18 March 1858 on the island of Hrappsey in north-western Iceland, Katrín Sigríður Skúladóttir was the daughter of Skúli Þorvaldsson Sívertsson, a farmer, and his wife Hlíf Jónsdóttir. Raised on Hrappsey, she first went to Reykjavik when she was 14 to visit her paternal aunt, Katrínar Sívertsen. There she met Guðmundur Magnusson, a physician and academic, who was a relative of Katrínar's husband, Jóni Árnasyn. She married Guðmundur in 1891 and they moved to Copenhagen. They returned to Iceland the following year, settling in Sauðárkrókur after her husband received an appointment at the hospital in Skagafjörður. Kartrín was also interested in medical work but the only training open to women was for midwives, which she did not find attractive. She nevertheless constantly helped her husband, sometimes taking care of his patients.

Katrín became active in social affairs, especially in connection with women's organizations. She joined the Icelandic Women's Association ("Íslenska kvenfélag") which she chaired from 1903 to 1924. In 1917, she helped to establish the Women's Alliance ("Bandalags kvenna"). She also served on the board of "Thorvaldsensfélag" (the Thorvaldsen Association), Iceland's oldest women's organization established in 1875. Interested in education, she participated in the school committee at Reyhjavik's "Kvennaskólan" (Women's School). Katrín was one of four women who sat on Reykjavik's municipal council from 1908 to 1916.

Katrín Magnússon died in Reykjavik on 13 July 1932.

Systema Solar

Systema Solar is a Barranquilla, Colombia-based dance music collective known for their party-oriented sound, which is influenced by the sound system DJ culture of the Caribbean. Their music combines elements of Afro-Caribbean music, champeta, bullerengue and cumbia, among other genres. 
Systema Solar originated in 2006, when DJ Vanessa Gocksch offered to create a band to play at an Art Biennial festival in Medellín, Colombia. Soon afterward, the hastily assembled septet made its debut performance in front of an audience of several thousand people. In 2009, their self-titled album was released, and the following year, it was re-released on Chusma Records. An expanded version of this album was later released by Nacional Records in March 2016, featuring tracks from a previous album they had released in 2013. In 2017, they released the album "Rumbo a Tierra". As of 2017, the group had six members.

"Rolling Stone" named the 2016 reissue of "Systema Solar" the third best Latin album of 2016, writing, "Vibrant and demanding, the Colombian psychedelic soundsystem champions the causes of immigrants and POC while commanding bystanders to get rowdy on the dance floor." 

NPR's Jessica Diaz-Hurtado wrote that "Rumbo a Tierra" "...takes listeners on a colorful and politically urgent journey', describing it as "a protest album that never lets its innovation stand in the way of its forcefulness." Ryan Patrick gave the album an 8 out of 10 rating in "Exclaim!", writing that "Systema Solar bring a "party with a message" mentality that melds future and folk sounds with innovative flair."

La Roche (horse)

La Roche (1897 – after 1920) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. As a two-year-old in 1899 she showed some promise, winning once from six attempts, but appeared to be some way below top class. In the following season, when tried over longer distance, she emerged as one of the best horses of her generation in England, winning the Oaks Stakes, Manchester Cup, Yorkshire Oaks and Newmarket Oaks as well as finishing fourth in the 1000 Guineas and third in the Doncaster Cup. She was retired at the end of the season to become a broodmare and had considerable success as a dam of winners.

La Roche was a small bay mare with no black leg points bred in England by her owner the 6th Duke of Portland. She was trained throughout her racing career by John Porter at his Kingsclere stable in Berkshire. As a three-year-old was described as "very sharp-looking, but not quite big enough for the best company.

She was one of the last notable horses sired by St. Simon, an undefeated racehorse who was considered one of the best British runners of the 19th Century. In an outstanding stud career he won nine sires’ championships, having sired ten Classic winners. Her dam, Miss Mildred showed no ability as a racehorse but was a granddaughter of the influential British broodmare Braxey.

On the day of the 1899 Epsom Oaks La Roche ran promisingly in the Acorn Stakes, finishing second to Dum Dum in a thirteen-runner field. La Roche was matched against male opponent in the British Dominion Two-Year-Old Race over five furlongs at Sandown Park on 24 June but after showing good early speed she came home last of the five runners behind Stealaway. She recorded her only victory of the year in September when she won the Prince of Wales's Nursery at Doncaster September. On her final run of the season she ran third in the Osmaston Nursery Plate at Derby Racecourse in November, conceding weight to the first finishers.

On 4 May La Roche began her second campaign in the 1000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse, starting at odds of 10/7 against ten opponents. Ridden by Mornington Cannon, she ran "very well" to take fourth place behind Winifreda, Inquisitive and Vain Duchess.

At Epsom Racecourse on 1 June La Roche, with Cannon again in the saddle, started the 5/1 third choice in the betting behind Winifreda and Lady Schomberg in a fourteen-runner field for the 122nd running of the Oaks Stakes. The weather was cold and windy and the crowd was unusually small although it included the Prince of Wales. Commenting on his trainee's chances before the race John Porter had said "she will run well, for she is a rare little sticker". 
La Roche was settled in mid-division before making steady progress into third place behind Lady Schomberg and Paigle entering the straight. She took the lead a quarter of a mile from the finish and drew away to win very easily by three lengths from Merry Gal, with Lady Schomberg coming home a distant third. The Oaks form received a boost on 5 July when Merry Gal scored an upset victory over Diamond Jubilee in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket.

One week after her Oaks triumph, La Roche followed up by "cantering" to victory under 107 pounds in the valuable Manchester Cup, a handicap race over one and three quarter miles at Manchester Racecourse. La Roche won again at York Racecourse on 28 August, when she "slaughtered" the opposition to take the Yorkshire Oaks from Inquisitive and Vain Duchess at odds of 1/4.

La Roche had never been entered in the St Leger, for which she might well have started favourite, and so was instead matched against older horses in the two and a quarter mile Doncaster Cup on 14 September at the same meeting. Despite carrying a ten pound weight penalty she started 5/6 favourite but after leading into the straight she was overtaken and beaten into third place behind King's Courier and Merry Gal. On her penultimate start of the year she started 1/10 favourite for the two-mile Newmarket Oaks on 9 October and won by eight lengths from her two opponents. For her final run of the season La Roche was assigned top weight of 122 for the Cambridgeshire Handicap over eight and a half furlongs at Newmarket on 24 October. Racing over a much shorter distance than she had attempted since May, she finished unplaced behind the four-year-old colt Berrill.

La Roche earned £8,000 as a three-year-old.

In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated La Roche an "average" winner of the Oaks.

After being retired from racing at the end of her second season, La Roche became a broodmare for the Duke of Portland's stud. She produced at least eight foals and three winners between 1902 and 1920:

Mary Arabella Stewart, Countess of Galloway

Arabella Stewart, Countess of Galloway (26 April 1850 – 18 August 1903), formerly Lady Mary Arabella Arthur Cecil, was the wife of Alan Stewart, 10th Earl of Galloway.

She was the daughter of James Brownlow William Gascoyne-Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Salisbury, and his second wife, the former Lady Mary Catherine Sackville-West. Her older half-brother, Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, was prime minister of the United Kingdom from 1886 to 1892 and again from 1895 to 1902.

She married the future earl on 25 January 1872, a year before he succeeded to his father's titles. As Lord Garlies, he was Conservative MP for Wigtownshire, thus representing the same party as his brother-in-law. 

There were no children from their marriage. The earl died in 1901, aged 65, and was succeeded in the earldom by his brother Randolph Henry Stewart, 11th Earl of Galloway. A portrait photograph of the countess, taken during the 1870s by John Watkins, is held by London's National Gallery.

The dowager countess had a London house at 17 Upper Grosvenor Street, but died at "Cuffnells", Lyndhurst, Hampshire, of pneumonia, aged 53.

Liñán's diffusion flame theory

Liñán diffusion flame theory is a theory developed by Amable Liñán in 1974 to explain the diffusion flame structure using activation energy asymptotics and Damköhler number asymptotics. Liñán used counterflowing jets of fuel and oxidizer to study the diffusion flame structure, analyzing for the entire range of Damköhler number. His theory predicted four different type of flame structure as follows,


The theory is well explained in the simplest possible model. Thus, assuming a one-step irreversible Arrhenius law for the combustion chemistry with constant density and transport properties and with unity Lewis number reactants, the governing equation for the temperature field formula_1 in the stagnation point flow reduces to

where formula_3 is the mixture fraction, formula_4 is the Damköhler number, formula_5 is the activation temperature and the fuel mass fraction and oxidizer mass fraction are scaled with their respective feed stream values, given by

with boundary conditions formula_7 and formula_8. Here, formula_9 (with formula_10) is the unburnt temperature profile (frozen solution) and formula_11 is the stoichiometric parameter (mass of oxidizer stream required to burn unit mass of fuel stream). The four regime are analyzed by trying to solve above equations using activation energy asymptotics and Damköhler number asymptotics. The solution to above problem is multi-valued.

Treating mixture fraction formula_3 as independent variable reduces the equation to

with boundary conditions formula_14 and formula_15, where formula_16.

The reduced Damköhler number is defined as follows

where formula_18 and formula_19. The theory predicted an expression for the reduced Damköhler number at which the flame will extinguish, given by

where formula_21.

Aedan: Garden of Desire () is a 2018 Indian Malayalam film directed by Sanju Surendran. The film stars Abhilash Nair, George Kurian, Prasant, Nandini Sree, Sunny, Jojo George, and Dileep Kumar. Aedan is more of a folktale in its elemental qualities and evocation of eternal human passions. Following the tradition of Indian epic narration, the structure of the film is that of a story within a story. The stories attempt a microscopic examination of the human psyche. As the story reverses through the emotional universes of the characters, the idyllic landscape of a beautiful Kerala village takes on diabolic dimensions in the night.


The film has received the following honors:


2017: Second Best Film

2017: Best adapted screenplay

FCM 1A

The FCM 1A was French heavy tank that served as a prototype of the Char 2C.

The FCM 1A began development in January 1917 when 200 hp engines became available. Trails where planned to start at the beginning of May after the first prototype began construction in April. However, after the failed Nivelle Offensive, the first operation where French tanks were used, all French tank development was halted. After a reversal of that decision, development was repeatedly delayed due to multiple problems.

Testing began on 20 November 1917 after six months of delays. The vehicle was the largest tank built up to that point, measuring long. The hull was extremely elongated in order to cross the trenches of the Western Front. The tank originally had a crew of 7, but the crew was reduced to 6 in December. The main armament was a shortened version of the Canon de 105 Court Schneider with a large ammunition capacity of 122 rounds.

It had a Renault 220 hp engine, allowing a maximum speed of and a minimum speed of . The suspension consisted of bogies, sprung by leaf springs, of four wheels. The tank could cross a gap and overcome a gap.

Mobility tests showed issues with the tank’s tracks and with the engine overheating, but mobility was deemed satisfactory. Firing tests conducted between 5 - 7 February 1918 also had satisfactory results.

Margaret of Sicily, Countess Palatine of the Rhine

Margaret of Sicily or Margherita di Sicilia-Aragona (Palermo, 1331 – Neustadt, 1377) was a Sicilian princess, daughter of the King Frederick III of Sicily and his wife Eleanor of Anjou. In 1348 she married Rudolf II, Count Palatine of the Rhine, and was Countess Palatine of the Rhine until 1353, year of the husband's death.

Margaret was the youngest daughter of King Frederick II of Sicily-Aragon (1272-1337) and his wife Eleanore, daughter of Charles II of Anjou. Her parents resided in Palermo, where she presumably was born.

In 1348 Margaret married the widowed Count Palatine Rudolf II from the house of Wittelsbach, who lived in Neustadt an der Weinstraße.

In 1349 Rudolf II married his daughter from his first marriage, Anna von der Pfalz, to King Charles IV, one of the most important rulers of the late Middle Ages. Anna died in Prague in 1353. Count Rudolf finally retired because of increasing illness, and handed the government business over to his brother and successor Ruprecht, who in 1356 was able to acquire the Electorate for the Palatinate. Rudolf II was nicknamed "the blind", because he had a serious eye disease and was blind in his last year of life.

The marriage of Rudolf II and Margaret of Sicily-Aragon remained childless.

Elizabeth of Portugal (1271-1336), Margaret's father's sister, is revered as a saint. Her mother's brother, Louis of Toulouse, is also one of the saints of the Catholic Church.

Pfalzgraf Rudolf II decreed that the church of Saint Ägidius (Giles) in Neustadt should be converted into a "memoria"—a place of prayer and commemoration—for the Wittelsbachs, and wished to be buried there.

After his death on October 4, 1353, he was buried according to his wishes in front of the altar of the Neustadt parish church of St. Giles.

In 1356 Elector Ruprecht I donated the Liebfrauen-Kollegiatstift Neustadt as memorial for his family, according to the will of his brother Rudolf II. He had the parish church of St. Ägidius rebuilt and extended to the east with a splendid choir. The chancel area of ​​this new church, the present Neustadt collegiate church, was built in 1368 according to a column inscription.

The altar of the new church now moved a good way east and the square in front of the altar of the old parish church, where Rudolf II had been buried, was now at the transition from the nave to the new choir area. At this point, in 1377, the Countess Margaret of Sicily-Aragon was buried next to her husband Rudolf II. She had survived him by 24 years.

Margaret of Sicily-Aragon received a splendid Gothic epitaph. Because of her royal origin, she is depicted on it with a crown. The gravestone is now located on the far north wall of the catholic church area and is one of the sights in Neustadt. Her husband Rudolf II possessed a similarly ornate grave plate, which, however, has survived only badly damaged and is also located in the Catholic church section on the rear south wall, opposite to his wife.

The graves of Count Palatine Rudolf and Countess Margaret of Sicily-Aragon lie in the rear of the Catholic part of the church, about the center, but are split by the 1707/1708 dividing wall between the Protestant nave and Catholic choir. In 1906 they were opened and re-covered with modern stone slabs, but not marked in the floor.

Around 1910, city pastor Michael Glaser (1863-1915) erected four large statues of the Palatine rulers Rudolf II and Ruprecht I, and the women buried by their side Beatrix of Berg and Margaret of Sicily-Aragon. They were created by the Munich sculptor Hubert Netzer from white Kelheim limestone and are located on the northern and southern nave wall of the Catholic part of the church. The sculptures, in the historicist style, are modeled on ancient representations. The two statues of women and the figure of Count Palatine Rudolf II are based on the images on their epitaphs in the collegiate church.

Dual power (leftist theory)

Dual power is a concept in the theory and practice of leftist politics, proposed in different forms by communists and anarchists. The communist conception of dual power, advanced by Vladimir Lenin to describe the division of power during the Russian Revolution, described the soviets of workers and soldiers as an incipient state whose task was to remove and replace the formal government. This notion has informed the strategies of subsequent communist-led revolutions, including the Chinese Revolution led by Mao.

The anarchist conception envisions the steady creation of mechanisms of self-management separate from the state apparatus. This strategy aims to create a libertarian socialist economy and polity by means of incrementally establishing and then networking institutions of direct participatory democracy to contest the existing power structures of state-capitalism. Dual power strategy was advocated by anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in 1851: "Beneath the governmental machinery, in the shadow of political institutions, out of the sight of statemen and priests, society is producing its own organism, slowly and silently; and constructing a new order, the expression of its vitality and autonomy." For some anarchists and libertarian socialists, this does not necessarily mean disengagement with existing institutions; for example, Yates McKee describes a dual power approach as "forging alliances and supporting demands on existing institutions — elected officials, public agencies, universities, workplaces, banks, corporations, museums — while at the same time developing self-organized counter-institutions." In this context, the strategy itself is sometimes also referred to as "counterpower" to differentiate it from the term's Leninist origins.

With the growth of the Zapatista movement, the system of local governance has been elaborated somewhat. Among the officials selected from each assembly, there are now commissioners for health and education, as well as a representative to a Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee (CCRI). The commissioners meet and coordinate with their peers on a regional basis, while there are four CCRIs, one for each language group in the area. The EZLN is subordinate to their decisions. This has fostered cooperation between community members and the EZLN, since "when a decision is made by the CCRI, it’s a decision based on consensus. It’s based on the agreement of dozens of families."

This local democracy has been extended by the creation of Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities, systems of alternative institutions that effectively replace local structures of power. On February 3, 1994, Manuel Camacho Solís, the conciliator between the government and the Zapatistas, announced the creation of two free zones in which the International Red Cross would operate and the militaries would not, unwittingly providing the Zapatista communities with a bit of national territory. On December 19, 1995, the EZLN broke the Mexican Federal Army’s encirclement and carried out the political and military seizure of dozens of towns, demonstrating that its influence went far beyond the small existing conflict zone. In this expanded area, Zapatista communities formed 38 autonomous municipalities covering more than a third of the state of Chiapas.

Autonomous municipalities are the Zapatistas’ implementation of the 16 February 1996 San Andrés Accords, which the government abandoned in December 1996, after refusing to carry them out. The Accords guarantee the right of indigenous peoples to form and govern traditionally their own municipalities. In forming the municipalities, residents derecognize the official authorities and elect their own. They refuse federal government involvement and control. They name their "local health promoters [and] indigenous parliaments, and elaborate their own laws based on social, economic, political and gender equality among the inhabitants of diverse ethnic communities." Councils are constituted to plan the various areas of community action and are joined by councils of elders and, increasingly, of women. These communities are accomplishing long-ignored aspirations, like building bilingual (Spanish and the local indigenous language) education systems, and providing to all what once was only provided in accordance with political patronage. A report from the Diocese of San Cristobal de las Casas finds: "At a local level municipal presidents imposed by the PRI are left governing only themselves, without being able to penetrate into the communities. Basically this means the slow destruction of…false democracy…and its replacement by communities and organizations that construct their own history first as autonomous municipalities and eventually as autonomous zones."
This eroding of the status quo has proceeded despite the attacks by the Mexican Federal Army and their paramilitary allies, providing a dramatic demonstration of the effectiveness of grassroots dual power. Whatever its accomplishments, the EZLN sees itself as a temporary formation: A "mirror image of the Mexican Army," it is "entirely unqualified to replace it" since it includes the hierarchy and violence that it would remove from society altogether. It will remain only "until the armed struggle becomes an absurdity and an obstacle for the revolutionary transformation of our country."

Think About You (Delta Goodrem song)

"Think About You" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Delta Goodrem. It was released on 16 February 2018. The song debuted on the ARIA singles chart at number 32, and later peaked at number 19, becoming Goodrem's 21st top 20 hit in Australia.

Upon release, Goodrem said: "As a songwriter, I look at the message that I want to convey in a song, in this case, and after working on a number of different projects, I genuinely went into the writing session with an open mind that it didn’t have to come with as much gravity in the sentiment, it just has to feel good. Every chapter of my career has been different and right now, with this song, I want people to just have fun." 

The song was teased over the course of several days across Goodrem's social media accounts, with snippets of the song being paired with scenes of Goodrem moving around at a photoshoot. Goodrem also did a performance as part of Channel V's Island Parties series to promote the song. She also did a series of radio interviews on all the major commercial stations around Australia. 

Jamie Velevski from Amnplify said "The upbeat, seductive track puts the songstress into a new spotlight as the use of sensual sounds and soft tones throughout the background are characteristics unseen to the artists' previous work." Adding that "with the team that put together Niall Horan's global hit "Slow Hands", there’s no denying that this fresh mature sound for Delta will also make waves." Mike Wass from Idolator called the song "a sexy, uptempo banger."

On February 16, Goodrem uploaded a video titled "Think About You (The Look Book)" to her Vevo page. It features monochrome footage of her at the photo shoot which produced the cover art for the single. As of 17 March, the video has more than 226,000 views.

Vermontville Opera House

The Vermontville Opera House is an auditorium located at 120 East First Street in Vermontville, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

Vermontville was first settled in 1836; it slowly developed, and in 1871 was incorporated into a village. At some point before 1881, an opera house was constructed in the village, and was owned by a succession of local residents until it burned in the mid-1890s. In 1895, the Vermontville Township purchased this plot of land and began construction of the opera house on the site, with the cornerstone laid on August 27. The building was completed in 1896.

The auditorium was well-used for dances, lectures, plays, musical performances, and vaudeville over the next several decades. The first story of the opera house originally housed office and meeting spaces for Vermontville Township and Village, along with the village's fire apparatus at the rear of the building. In 1948, the Vermontville Library took over the former village council rooms. In 1973, the fire department moved out and the library expanded; the building itself was renovated by infilling the former fire house doors.. As of 2018, the building still housed both the library and the Township offices.

The Vermontville Opera House is a rectangular three-story structure with walls faced in concrete block in the first story and red brick above. The building has a mansard roof and a foundation of rock-face fieldstone ashlar. Window bays are separated by slightly projecting piers, which stretch upward to the cornice line. The windows have segmental arches and cut stone sills and caps with prominent keystones. The cornice is or pressed metal. A square tower at one corner has a bell-shaped roof and paired windows with store trim. On the main facade are two entrances: a single door in the center leading into the first story, and an entrance in the tower leading to the auditorium at the second floor level. 

The building contains a first floor originally housing offices and the fire department, and now houses the library. The upper floors housing a level-floor auditorium with rear gallery. The auditorium is entered through a lobby, where a ticket office is also located. The auditorium itself is a two-story high space, flat in the center and sloping around the perimeter. A small stage is at the front, and a balcony at the rear above the lobby.

The Boys & Girls Club continued to use the building until 2000, when a new facility was completed two blocks away. Subsequently, the older building was occupied by a charter school until 2014 and then converted into apartments. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018.

DR-WebSpyder

DR-WebSpyder is an operating system developed by Caldera UK in 1997 that is based on the DR-DOS operating system from Novell and the Arachne Web Browser by Michal Polák of Arachne labs. It uses the web browser as its principal user interface. 

DR-WebSpyder was originally conceived as project NIOS (Novell Internet Operating System) at Novell’s European Development Center, UK in 1994 by then DR-DOS Engineer Roger Gross, who was working on Novell’s Embedded Systems Technology (NEST) initiative to create embedded system applications that connect intelligent devices to NetWare networks. NIOS was conceived as a Thin Client Operating System that provided Novell with a graphical client Operating System to run Web Applications hosted on NetWare, creating a Novell centric platform for Software as a service that did not require Microsoft’s Windows operating system. NIOS comprised 32-bit versions of Novell’s existing 16-bit DOS technologies including the DR-DOS operating system, Novell's dialer and TCP/IP stack plus licensed third-party components including the Kaffe Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Allegro for graphics and Mosaic for the Web Browser. 

Gross’s plans were interrupted when Caldera acquired the DR-DOS assets from Novell on July 24 1996 but without the personnel. Gross telephoned Caldera’s Ransom Love the same day offering to setup a new DR-DOS team outside of Novell. Gross subsequently joined Caldera as General manager of the Digital Research Systems Group in December that year and set about rehiring the DRDOS/NIOS team in the UK to develop the new Operating System and Web Browser. Under Caldera, NIOS was renamed IOS (Internet Operating System). The plan to use Mosaic was also dropped and instead Caldera licensed the source code of the Arachne web browser. The team replaced Arachne’s Dialer and packet drivers with Novell's Dialer and TCP/IP stack, added support for animated GIFs, additional printers, JavaScript, new Frames support and an optional on-screen keyboard for mouse and touch panel usage (SoftKeyboards). 

In 1997 the Digital Research Systems group and Caldera UK was spun out as a separate company Caldera Thin Clients and IOS became formerly known as DR-WebSpyder. 

On May 11th 1998 Caldera started shipping DR-WebSpyder v2.0 as both a web browser application and a Browser OS and in June opened a sales and support office in Taiwan to be close to potential OEM customers.

In September 1998 DR-WebSpyder achieved commercial success when it was selected for use in an internet set-top box as part of a Satellite internet access solution. 

Also in 1998 Caldera distributed a free demo version of DR-WebSpyder on a bootable fully self-contained 3.5-inch floppy. This was in fact the DRWebSpyder OS, minus the Kaffe JVM, but configured as loosely coupled components in which the DOS shell COMMAND.COM was replaced with the Web Browser. On 386 PCs with a minimum of 4 MB of RAM, the floppy would boot the DR-DOS 7.02 based browser operating system complete with memory manager, RAM disk, dial-up modem, LAN, mouse and display drivers and automatically launch into the graphical browser, without ever touching the machine's hard disk. Users could start browsing the web immediately after entering their access credentials. 

In July 1999 Caldera Thin Clients became Lineo and Dr-WebSpyder was renamed Lineo Embrowser..

Eleonora degli Albizzi

Eleonora degli Albizzi (Florence, 1543 - Florence, 19 March 1634) was a mistress of Cosimo I de' Medici, the Granduke of Tuscany. She bore him an illegitimate son, Don Giovanni de' Medici.

She was the daughter of an ancient Florentine family of moderate means, daughter of Luigi degli Albizzi and Nannina Soderini. With the consent of her father, by 1565, at the age of about 23–24 years, she became the mistress of the Granduke, who was a widow since the death of Eleonora of Toledo in 1562. In 1566, Albizzi bore the Duke a daughter who soon died as an infant. In 1567, she bore him the son Giovanni.

Rumors began to circulate that Cosimo wish to legitimize his union to Eleonora. Tradition holds that his long-time chamberlain Sforza Almeni of Perugia shared the Duke's desires with Francesco I, the legitimate heir who was increasingly the dominant force in the government. Francesco, likely worried about the entry of potential heirs and a mother-in-law, scolded his father about those plans. Thereupon, seized by rage because his secret desires had been revealed, on May 22, 1566, the Granduke is said to personally stabbed his chamberlain to death. This event, along with others episodes such as the rumored murder of Filippo Strozzi the Younger, reinforced a perception that Cosimo was possessed of an excessively passionate, if not bloodthirsty, ruthlessness.

The love affair between Cosimo and Eleonora quickly cooled, and by 1567 she was forced to marry the dishonored nobleman Carlo Panciatichi. Cosimo meanwhile latched on to an affair with another young woman, Camilla Martelli. Panchiato had faced execution for rebellion, and was herewith pardoned and granted a reward of 10 thousand scudi to take Eleonora. It is unclear what role his legitimate children played in arranging to remove Albizzi from the Grand Duke's orbit.

Eleonora had three children with Carlo, including Bartolomeo (born 1577). However, in 1578, she was accused of adultery and confined to the Monastery of Fuligno. She lived at the monastery for the last 56 years of her life.

Mongol raid on Meissen

Mongols first invasion of Germany located in the Great European Plain, part of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the farthest west they had successfully launched a raid in the Mongol advance of Europe. The united Polish and German Forces were annihilated in the battle of Legnica by a Mongol reconnaissance party led by Orda Khan who is solely responsible for the complete destruction of the Kingdom of Poland preventing Wenceslaus I of Bohemia from using its army to form a large coalition with Henry II the Pious. Orda Khan spread absolute fear and destruction in Central and Eastern Europe, to further divide and conquer European forces.

The Mongols had decisively won the battle of Legnica, Almost all of the combined Polish and German forces in Legnica had been annihilated. Wenceslaus I of Bohemia with a standard army of 50,000 strong heads for Legnica to meet with Henry II the Pious. When he heard that the Mongols had won the Battle of Legnica and killed Henry II the Pious, The Mongols raid to his Kingdom in Saxony, Wenceslaus I of Bohemia pull back its forces to make haste against the Mongol raid of his kingdom.

One of the Mongol light reconnaissance had pillage through Meissen, Germany and destroyed most of the town before the army of Wenceslaus I of Bohemia came for its relief. Later it is revealed the attack of Meissen and parts of Bohemia is part of Orda Khan plan to trick Wenceslaus I of Bohemia to avoid facing its large army, and to accomplished his mission to meet with the main Mongol force. The destruction of Meissen had forced Henry Raspe, Landgrave of Thuringia to write a letter to his father-in-law Henry II, Duke of Brabant describing the raid of the Mongols.

“For a cruel and countless horde of people lawless and wild is now invading and taking possessions of the territories adjoining ours and has now roving through many other countries and exterminating their inhabitants extended their incursions as far as the polish territory of these matters we our fully informed by our own messengers as well as by the letters of our own beloved cousin the king of Bohemia and have been called to prepare ourselves with all the haste to proceed to his assistance and the defense of all Christians for we our truly and fully informed by our messengers that this said race of people the tartars is will cruelly and impetuously invade the Bohemian territory about the octaves of Easter and if seasonable assistance is not given to the bohemians an unheard slaughter will take place and as our house adjoining our own is already on fire and as the neighboring country is open to devastation while some countries are now being ravaged we on behalf of the church universal anxiously invoke and beg assistance and advice from God and our neighboring brother princes and as delay as pregnant with danger we beg of you with all possible deligence to take arms and to hasten our aid for the sake of our freedom as well as for that of your own and to use strenuous endeavors to prepare a powerful force by arousing the powerful and brave nobles with people subject to them to hold them ready and prepared until we again send it our messengers to you.”

Wenceslaus I of Bohemia was horrified by the raid, sought reinforcements in Thuringia and Saxony that he hid it’s forces in the mountains of Bohemia paralyzed by fear (A most common reaction to a Mongol threat).
By the end of April 1241, Orda Khan entered Moravia and successfully pillaged the wealthy villages of the Kingdom of Bohemia easily without an army on sight. A cunning victory for the Mongols before combining forces with the main Mongol army in Hungary. A large European force are virtually none existent to deal with a small Mongol attack that depopulated Troppau, Mahrisch-Neustadt, Freudenthal, and among other towns in Moravia to Slovakia.

The main Mongol army have won the Battle of Mohi and forced Europe in a vulnerable position. The ravaging of Saxony, Moravia, Bohemia and Mongol offensive in the suburbs around Vienna. Only the death of Ögedei Khan stopped the Mongol advance further west.

Fedora Alemán

Fedora Alemán (11 October 1912 – 6 February 2018) was a Venezuelan operatic soprano. One of Venezuela's most celebrated singers, she performed in concert halls throughout Latin America and Europe.

Born in Caracas on 11 October 1912, Alemán began to play the piano when she was six. Her vocal talents were recognized from an early age, especially when she reached her teens. She studied at the Escuela de Música y Declamación in Caracas before training in New York under Fausto Cleva and, in particular, Alfredo Hollander in Caracas.

In her early twenties, Alemán married the American cellist Mario Di Polo whom she met in New York when she was 22. They remained married until he died in 1975. The couple had three children: Reinaldo, a scientific researcher; Mario, a violinist, and Frank, a trumpeter.

Her first recording, on the RCA Victor label, was made in New York while her first public performance was in 1936 at Caracas's Teatro Municipal. It was also here she sang her first opera, Pergolesi's "La serva padrona". She went on to perform leading roles in Verdi's "Rigoletto" and "La Traviata".

From 1950, her concert tours reached North America, Brazil and Europe. She performed in the United States, in Rio de Janeiro, and in 1951 in the Caribbean. In 1954, she participated in the "Primar Festival de Música Latinoamericana de Caracas" (First Caracas Festival of Latin American Music), with "Bachianas Brasileñas" by Heitor Villa-Lobos. In 1956, she sang Lucy from the opera of Gian Carlo Menotti: "The Telephone, or L'Amour à trois". In 1961, she travelled to France and Italy where she undertook further voice training. The following year she performed at the Grand Théâtre in Bordeaux.

After appearances in Nice and Paris, she traveled in 1964 to Israel, where she appeared in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. The following year, she sang the world premiere of "Cuatro canciones sefardíes" by Joaquín Rodrigo at the Ateneo de Madrid and in the auditorium of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. In 1971, she received the first prize in the "Certosa Festival" in Italy. In 1974, she was elected Woman of the Year in Venezuela. In 1977 she received the "National Music Award ", and in 1992 the Andrés Bello award. The Simón Bolívar University called her "a pioneer of lyrical singing in Venezuela". She was a music teacher from 2006, with a doctorate honoris causa.

Celebrated Venezuelan and foreign composers have created works for Alemán. These include "Por los caminos de Zorca y Petrea" by Blanca Estrella de Méscoli, "La renuncia" by Antonio Estévez, "Vuelas al fin" by Moisés Moleiro, "Canción a Fedora" by José Reina, "Giraluna lejana" by Inocente Carreño, "Alma no me digas nada" by Ana Mercedes Asuaje de Rugeles and "Pájaro del agua" by Joaquín Rodrigo.

After retiring from the stage in 1989, together with the Venezuelan soprano Lotty Ipinza, she founded the Taller de Técnica Vocal Fedora Alemán in Caracas, initially aimed at aspiring singers with limited resources and currently to stimulate the participation of young people attracted to singing.

The critic Ana Mercedes Asuaje de Rugeles (1914-2012) commented: 

She died on 6 February 2018, of natural causes, at the age of 105.

Alemán was named "Mujer de Venezuela" (Woman of Venezuela) in 1974. She has also received the "Orden de la Ciudad de Caracas" (Order of the City of Caracas), the "Orden Andrés Bello" and the "Orden Río Branco". A music centre in central Caracas bears her name while the Fedora Alemán medal is awarded for lyrical excellence in the Venezuelan National Singing Contest.

Kasselburg

The Kasselburg is a ruined hill castle on a 490-metre-high basalt massif in Pelm near Gerolstein in the county of Vulkaneifel in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The symbol of the Kasselburg is its 37-metre-high, double tower, which functioned as a gate tower and tower house, whose origins are not precisely clear. Hitherto it had been assumed that the lords of Blankenheim had built it shortly after 1335, but structural investigations have shown that the tower underwent several phases of construction and cannot just be the work of one architect. The gate probably lost its guarding function with the expansion of the castle from 1452. It is from that period that the large outer bailey, with its "burgmann" houses and domestic buildings, dates.

The double tower is open to the public and has a good view of the surrounding area but, despite its size, is not a "bergfried" (fighting tower). The latter, built around 1200, is smaller and stands in the eastern part of the inner bailey. It has a square ground plan and was turned into a tower house in the 14th century.

Also part of the inner ward is the almost 33-metre-long "palas", which dates to the 14th century.

The castle was built in the 12th century. Its owners may have been the lords of Castel, but this is not entirely certain. The castle was first mentioned in 1291 as the "Castilburg". In 1314, it is called "Castelberch".

According to the current state of research, it is not clear who the owner of the castle was before 1335. However, it is certain that Gerhard V of Blankenheim became its owner following a division of inheritance in that year and thus founded the Blankenheim-Kasselburg line. In 1406, this line of Blankenheims, which had been elevated to the countship, died out with Count Gerhard VII. The castle then passed by marriage to William I of Loen and thus to Heinsberg.

Other owners followed, including the counts of the Mark, dukes of Arenberg and prince-electors of Trier. Many interest groups have claimed the Kasselburg for themselves throughout history, so that in 1674 the Imperial Chamber Court of Wetzlar was called upon to put an end to the property disputes. When the judges awarded the castle to the dukes of Arenberg, the buildings soon served as barracks for the Duke of Arenberg's artillery. This marked the beginning of the decline of the castle: in the 18th century it was still temporarily the seat of an Arenberg forester, but by 1744 it was described as dilapidated.

After France seized the castle in 1794, it went to the Prussia in 1815. An impulse to rescue the ruin came unexpectedly from King Frederick William IV in 1838. After a visit he initiated repair work, and after the completion of the railway line from Cologne to Trier, the railway company donated 1,000 talers to open up the then already famous double tower in order to "offer its passengers something".

At the beginning of the 20th century, the state historic preservation authorities carried out further restoration. The Castle Administration of Rhineland-Palatinate, who took over Kasselburg in 1946, also had conservation measures carried out. In the meantime, the site has been placed under the care of the Directorate for Castles, Palaces and Ancient Monuments of theGeneral Directorate for Cultural Heritage Rhineland-Palatinate, since 1998 the successors to the former Castle Administration.

Michel-Philippe Bouvart (Chartres, 11 January 1717 – Paris, 19 January 1787) was a French medical doctor.

He was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1743 and a professor in the Faculty of Medicine in 1745 and also in the Collège Royal in 1745, where he took the medical chair previously held by Pierre-Jean Burette. Louis XV granted him letters of nobility and the Order of St. Michael in 1768 or 1769.

Bouvart was famous for his quick diagnoses and accurate prognoses, but also for his caustic wit and polemical writing against his fellow physicians, notably Théodore Tronchin, Théophile de Bordeu, Exupère Joseph Bertin, Antoine Petit. He was opposed to inoculation against smallpox. He championed Virginia polygala or Seneka as a remedy for snakebite.

Although he was able and learned, he is perhaps best known for his witticisms.

Bouvart's father Claude was a physician. Michel-Philippe received his medical degree in Reims in 1730 and practiced in Chartres. In 1736, he left for Paris.

<doc id="56579238" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56579238" title="The Test Case">
The Test Case

"The Test Case" is a short story by English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse. The last of seven stories featuring the fictional character Reggie Pepper, it was published in the UK in "Pearson's Magazine" in December 1915, and in the US in "Illustrated Sunday Magazine" on 12 December 1915.

In the story, Reggie intends to prove his intelligence to the woman he wants to marry, Ann Selby. He hopes to accomplish this by healing a rift between Ann's sister Hilda and Hilda's husband Harold, who spends too much time talking about his first wife Amelia.

Reggie states that he was once in love with Ann Selby. Though he is now glad that she refused him, he feels that she did not treat him fairly. He then recounts the following story. Not for the first time, Reggie proposes to Ann Selby. Instead of refusing him as usual, she says that Reggie seems brainless but might have potential. However, she is hesitant about marriage because of what is happening between her sister Hilda and Hilda's husband, Reggie's friend Harold Bodkin. Harold often praises his deceased first wife Amelia, and every evening he goes into the studio room at the top of their house to meditate on Amelia's memory and lay flowers in front of her portrait. Hilda feels unappreciated, but pretends not to mind. Reggie assures Ann that he is not like Harold. Ann agrees to marry Reggie if Reggie does something to prove his intelligence.

To prove himself and to help a friend, Reggie decides to address the situation with Harold and Hilda. He plans to make Harold overdo his meditations on Amelia so that Harold will get tired of it. Reggie talks to Harold, who is oblivious that Hilda is upset, and persuades Harold to postpone dinner in order to spend more time with Amelia's portrait each evening. This displeases Harold's butler Ponsonby since he needs to work longer. Reggie also gets Harold to invite Amelia's ill-mannered brother Percy to the house. Lastly, Reggie intends to use a wedge to jam the studio room door and trap Harold there for a few hours.

After hearing someone enter the studio room, Reggie jams the door shut with a wedge and then dines out, returning a few hours later. He sees Ann, who says that Hilda, fed up with Harold's latest actions, announced she would leave Harold. Reggie explains that he suggested Harold lengthen his meditations and invite Percy as part of a larger plan. Ann disapproves, but notes that Hilda's actions prompted Harold to change. Earlier that day, Harold called Ponsonby and told him to take down Amelia's portrait. Harold then appears and says that he cannot find Ponsonby. Reggie, realizing where Ponsonby is, is struck speechless.

Harold finds the studio door locked and hears Ponsonby's voice. Harold lets him out, and Ponsonby gives notice before heading to the pantry to eat. Admitting that he shut Ponsonby in the room, Reggie explains that he was trying to trap Harold. Ann thinks that Reggie is a practical joker and denounces him. Reggie tries to defend himself to Ann, but is unsuccessful.

In the original British edition, the story is set in England, and Harold and Hilda live in Hertfordshire. In the American edition, the story takes place in America, and Harold and Hilda live in Long Island.

"The Test Case" was illustrated by Lewis Baumer in "Pearson's Magazine" and by F. Foster Lincoln in "Illustrated Sunday Magazine".

The story was published in the collection "The Uncollected Wodehouse", published in 1976 by Seabury Press. The British edition of "The Test Case" was included in "Enter Jeeves", a 1997 collection published by Dover Publications, featuring all the Reggie Pepper stories and eight early Jeeves stories.

<doc id="56579283" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56579283" title="Plasmodium brasilianum">
Plasmodium brasilianum

Plasmodium brasilianum is a parasite that infects many species of platyrrhine monkeys in South and Central America.

The simian "Plasmodium brasilianum" causes quartan fever in New World monkeys and resembles "Plasmodium malariae" morphologically. Sequence analysis of circumsporozoite protein, merozoite surface protein-1, and small subunit ribosomal RNA of "P. malariae" and "P. brasilianum" showed that the two parasites were very closely related. The similarity between 18S sequences from "P. brasilianum" and "P. malariae" is more than 99% differing only in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). It is considered plausible that "P. brasilianum" in platyrrhines is a result of the cross-species transfer of "P. malariae" brought to the New World by settlers in the post-Columbus era.

"Plasmodium brasilianum" naturally infects species of primates from all New World monkey families from a large geographic area in Central and South America. The parasite has been found in Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and French Guiana.

Natural infection of "P. brasilianum" has been found in tamarins and marmosets of the genera "Callithrix", "Leontopithecus" and "Mico" in the Atlantic forest. Naturally acquired infections in humans with parasites termed as "P. brasilianum" have been found among Yanomami indigenous communities of the Venezuelan Amazon. Also "Anopheles freeborni" mosquitoes infected by feeding on a platyrrhine spider monkey ("Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi") from Panama carrying "P. brasilianum", have been shown to transmit the parasite through biting to five human volunteers. Investigations in the 1960s demonstrated that humans could be experimentally infected with "P. brasilianum" from monkeys and vice versa. In addition to humans, "P. brasilianum" has been transmissible experimentally to marmosets.

In 1908, a quartan malaria parasite was identified by Gonder and von Berenberg-Gossler in an imported bald uakari ("Cacajao calvus") and named "Plasmodium brasilianum", the quartan malaria parasite of New World monkeys in Latin America. It resembled the human quartan parasite "Plasmodium malariae" under the microscope, but early cross-species experimental infections by subcutaneous transfer of parasitized blood from black spider monkeys in the 1930s were unsuccessful. Hence, the names of two distinct parasites were maintained.

Andria Lawrence is an English actress and writer.

Andria Lawrence made her first film appearance in the 1960 comedy "In the Nick", starring Anthony Newley. Her appearances in both TV and film productions of much-loved 1970s British sitcom "On the Buses" won her an enduring audience. Her performance as "Turnaround Betty" in the 1971 "On the Buses" film exemplified the amorous type of comic role which made her often one of the most appealing parts of productions in which she was a supporting player. Her appearance as Ziza in the 1971 Hammer Film Production "Countess Dracula" is, again, though but a supporting role, one which provides some of the film's most eye-catching moments.

She made numerous television appearances. Her first parts as a named character came in 1960-1 in detective series "No Hiding Place"; her most recent listed TV appearance was in the 1981 "Jim Davidson Show". She was busiest in the 1970s, which saw her cast memorably in some fondly remembered British TV comedy series; besides "On the Buses", examples include "Doctor at Large" and "The Fenn Street Gang". But she demonstrated skill in drama, too, appearing in Ken Loach's acclaimed slice of gritty realism "Cathy Come Home", along with several other productions in the BBC's notable "Wednesday Play" series, and police dramas "Van der Valk" and, near the end of its long run, "Dixon of Dock Green".

Lawrence is also a published writer, having composed a number of magazine articles before in 2016 publishing a novel, "The Olive Tree".

Omek tannou or Oumouk tangou is an ancient Tunisian tradition of invocation of the rain which was inherited from the Punic and Berber tradition. It has practically disappeared nowadays.

It is manifested in the form of a statue head of a woman similar to girls' dolls. The children walk her between the houses during a drought while singing "Oumouk tango, O women, ask God to rain" (). This song varies according to the region because the term " chta " designates rain only in certain urban cities. Each housewife then pours a little water on the statuette believing that it will bring rain.

In some rural cities, a stick is used, instead of the doll, to which each woman attaches a piece of clothing and gives some Barley to the children who go away singing "Bouktambou" [Oumouk tangou deformation] " give us barley, your container will be filled from the water sources " ().

Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women's Suffrage

The Glasgow and West of Scotland Association for Women’s Suffrage was an organisation involved in campaigning for women’s suffrage, based in Glasgow, with members from all over the west of Scotland.

The association met for the first time in 1902, in the home of founding chair Mrs Greig, at 18 Lynedoch Crescent, Glasgow. Further meetings (until 1909) were held in the offices of the Scottish Council for Women's Trades at 58 Renfield Street. Greig was, for many years president of the Glasgow Women's Liberal Association , and, along with fellow members Dr Alice McLaren, Dr Elizabeth Pace, Grace Paterson & Margaret Irwin (trade unionist) was also a member of the GCWT.

The organisation is considered to be a non-militant suffrage association. Their methods of influence included drawing-room meetings, addressed by prominent male and female suffragists, as well as networking with other organisations, such as The Primrose League, West of Scotland Women's Liberal Unionist Association, Scottish Women's Liberal Federation, Glasgow Council for Women's Trades & British Women's Temperance Association.

The close links between the Glasgow Council for Women's Trades have been noted by Elspeth King: "There is no doubt that the Suffrage Society of 1902 was essentially the child of the Scottish Council for Women's Trades. The frenetic attempts of the executive committee to persuade the Countess of Aberdeen, Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair to accept the presidency was due to the fact that she had been President of the parent body since its inception, and President of the International Council of Women since 1893." The countess was unable to accept the presidency, presumably owing to her workload. 

Elspeth King notes that the social status of the members was a key driver of their activities. " [It] helped to attract the support of a succession of Liberal Lord Provosts and Town Councillors, and Members of Parliament." 

From the earliest days, members of the organisation travelled throughout the West of Scotland, addressing meetings and facilitating the setting up of branches of the organisation, in places such as Greenock , Motherwell and Kilmacolm , the latter in cooperation with the Kilmacolm Women's Liberal Association. They also took their campaign with them as they travelled doon the watter to the Clyde coastal resorts, such as Helensburgh, Troon, Saltcoats, Dunoon and Rothesay . A branch of the association was established in Greenock, in 1904 .

In November 1907, a deputation met with the Prime Minister, Lloyd George at the North British Station Hotel. “He was asked by Mrs Hunter for a pledge that the Government would bring in a women's suffrage Bill before this Parliament came to the end of its career.” 

After the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, the Association quickly moved on to promoting women candidates in local government elections. The Women's Local Representation Joint Committee was formed of a number of different organisations with similar aims. These were the Voter's Council, the Women's Educational Union, the Glasgow Women's Citizen's Association, a body formed by members of the Women's Freedom League, the National Council of Women, and the Glasgow Society for Women's Suffrage. It was chaired by Mary Anderson Snodgrass who would go on to be a Town Councillor and Bailie of the city of Glasgow . This coalition of organisations had the role of a pressure group, promoting legislation favourable to women.

In 1933, the societies were dissolved for financial reasons, however, the women continued to meet in Queen Margaret Union at University of Glasgow until the 1960s.

Caesar (1810 ship)

Caesar was launched in 1810 on the Thames River. She sailed first as a West Indiaman, and then after 1814 to the East Indies under a license from the British East India Company (EIC). In 1817 she repatriated from Batavia to London Lord William Amherst and the offices and crew of . "Caesar" is last listed in 1824.

"Caesar" enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1810 with J. Fowler, master, Fowler & Co., owner, and trade London–Jamaica. Captain Jonathon Fowler acquired a letter of marque on 10 November 1810.

On 13 October 1812 Captain James Shand acquired a letter of marque. "Lloyd's Register" for 1813 shows "Caesar"s master changing from Fowler to Shand. In 1814 M. Fowler replaced J. Shand.

The "Register of Shipping" for 1816 shows "Caesar"s master changing from Shand to Taylor, her owner from Fowlgen to C.H. Turner, and her trade from London–Jamaica to Bombay. The EIC had lost its monopoly on the trade between England and India and "Caesar" acquired a licence from the EIC to trade with India. Captain J. Taylor sailed from England in December 1816, bound for Fort William, India.

In 1817 Lord Amherst was returning on from his embassy to China. On 18 February "Alceste" grounded on one of the many hidden reefs in the Java Sea. She was wrecked, and first Lord Amherst and his party, and then the rest of "Alceste"s officers and crew reached Batavia. Lord Amherst then engaged "Caesar", which was at Batavia, to take all the survivors back to England.

"Caesar" sailed on 17 April with Lord Amherst, his party, and the officers and men of "Alceste". Several events marked the voyage. (Different sources give inconsistent dates for arrival and departure dates for "Caesar"s stops on her way home.)

On 5 May, while "Caesar" was about 200 miles south of Mauritius a fire broke out in the spirit room. "Aceste" men. especially her gunner, were instrumental in putting it out. "Caesar" arrived at Simon's Bay on 27 May.

"Caesar" sailed again in company with for St Helena on 11 June. Before leaving Batavia, "Caesar" had also loaded two unusual passengers, an orangutan and a python. Several accounts of the voyage mention the feeding of the python, and its dissection after its death on the way to St Helena. The orangutan eventually had free run of the ship and arrived safely in England.

"Caesar" arrived at St Helena on 27 June. On 28 June Lord Amherst, Captain Maxwell of "Alceste", and Mr. Lynn, her surgeon, met with Napoleon Bonaparte. They reported an amicable discussion.

On 29 June, or 3 July, "Caesar" left St Helena. She arrived at Ascension Island on 7 July. She stayed less than a day, stopping only long enough to load eight large turtles. "Caesar" arrived at Spithead on 16 August.

"Caesar" continued to trade with the East Indies on her return from repatriating Lord Amherst and the crew of "Alceste". She is last listed in the "Register of Shipping" in 1824, and in "Lloyd's Register" in 1825. Her actual fate is currently obscure.

Juan Alberto Fuentes

Juan Alberto Fuentes Knight is a Guatemalan economist, politician, and non-profit official. Among other roles, he has served as Minister of Finance in Guatemala and as chairman of Oxfam International.

Fuentes is the son of Alberto Fuentes Mohr. He studied Economics at McGill University and the University of Toronto, and received his PhD from the University of Sussex. Fuentes has held positions with the United Nations in Costa Rica, Mexico, Chile, and Guatemala. He was founder and Director of the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (ICEFI), the first think tank of its kind in the region.

From 2008 to 2010, Fuentes served as Minister of Finance in Guatemala. In this role, he steered the country’s finances through the turbulent Great Recession, implementing moderate countercyclical policies to soften the impact of the global economic downturn. He also created a vice ministry dedicated to transparency in use of public funds. Alongside other initiatives, this new vice ministry spurred significant improvement in Guatemala’s standing in the International Transparency Ranking, as the country moved up by 12 spots. After his time in office, Fuentes authored a popular book, "Rendición de Cuentas" ("For Accountability"), detailing his experiences while leading the Ministry. 

Fuentes resigned as Minister of Finance in 2010, citing anomalies in the use of public funds and inability to pass a progressive fiscal reform. He went on to serve as Regional Advisor of the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) in Mexico City. He then worked as Director of the Division of Economic Development at ECLAC in Santiago, Chile, where he conducted research on macroeconomic challenges and fiscal reform in Latin America and the Caribbean. Following this role, he taught courses in Economics at Universidad Rafael Landívar in Guatemala City, served as an independent consultant on economic integration and political economy, and participated in the organization of a new Guatemalan political initiative called Semilla.

On 13 February 2018, Fuentes was detained, alongside all other members of President Álvaro Colom's Cabinet, as part of a corruption investigation dating back to his time in government. The legal process is ongoing and he has not been convicted of any charges. He resigned the same day as president of Oxfam International. Upon his resignation, Oxfam International's executive director, Winnie Byanyima, issued the following statement: “Oxfam does not yet know the nature of formal charges, if any, against Dr. Fuentes Knight. However, he has been entirely open with his Oxfam board and executive that he has been among former officials being investigated as part of a budgetary transaction made by the Guatemalan government while he was finance minister. He has assured us that he has cooperated fully with the investigation in the confidence he did not knowingly transgress rules or procedures.”

Alice Cliff Scatcherd

Alice Cliff Scatcherd (1842–1906) was an early British suffragist who in 1889 founded the Women's Franchise League, with Harriet McIlquham, Ursula Bright, Emmeline Pankhurst, Richard Pankhurst and Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy.

Scatcherd was born in Wortley and was a lifelong campaigner for women's rights who lived much of her life in Morley, West Yorkshire including in Morley Hall. Scatcherd donated Scatcherd Park to the town.

She was secretary for the Leeds branch of the National Society for Women's Suffrage (NSWS).

Scatcherd was active in speaking out at events in the 1870s as typified by an example on 24 March 1877, when she appeared alongside Lydia Becker and other early suffragettes to discuss women's access to the vote in Macclesfield. The chairman, J. W. White, addressed the meeting saying that ""it appeared somewhat strange that whereas the British Parliament had been engaged from time to time for many years back in conferring rights and removing disabilities, there should still exist any large and intelligent section of society outside the electoral community. They had not yet found any good reason given for excluding from parliamentary suffrage women who had already voted in municipal and school board elections; therefore they intended to reiterate their demands until they were conceded"". Scatcherd was supported by Henry Birchenough in seconding the first resolution which was moved by Joshua Oldfield Nicholson.

The Alice Cliff Scatcherd scrapbooks on microfilm (MIC Y B SCA) comprise letters, photos and letterpress relating to the national suffrage campaign, politics, education and Morley civic life and are held at Morley Library.

Scatcherd was married to Oliver Scatcherd, a textile factory owner and Mayor of Morley. Scatcherd was critical of the existing nature of marriage and refused to attend wedding services in established churches where women took a vow of obedience to men. She shocked late 19th Century conservative society by travelling Europe with her husband without a wedding ring.

Scatcherd is buried in St Mary in the Wood churchyard, Morley.

Russian interference in the 2018 United States elections

The United States Intelligence community assessed that Russia is interfering with the 2018 United States elections.

Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats stated during congressional testimony that "the United States is under attack" from Russian efforts. As of February 13, 2018, six US intelligence agencies unanimously assessed that Russian hackers are scanning American electoral systems and using bot armies to promote partisan causes on social media. Previously, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also warned that Russia is currently interfering in the 2018 midterm election.

In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on February 13, Coats noted that voting in some elections will begin as early as March 2018. He stated: "We need to inform the American public that this is real, that this is going to happen." At the same hearing, CIA Director Mike Pompeo told the committee that Russia has already been observed engaging in such tactics.

During a March 6, 2018 press conference in the White House, President Trump was questioned on the topic of possible interference in the upcoming midterm election, responding “We won’t allow that to happen. We’re doing a very, very deep study, and we’re coming out with, I think, some very strong suggestions on the ’18 election," adding, “we’ll counteract whatever they do.”

2004 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 2004 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 79th year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Irish racing was experiencing promising growth with increased prize money for competitions including the richest ever prize for a marathon event when the Corn Cuchulainn offered €50,000 for the winner at Harold's Cross.

The situation in Britain was not as simple after Richard Caborn, the Minister for Sport announced that it had been agreed that the bookmakers levy fund would increase to 0.5% in 2004, 0.55% in 2005 and 0.6% in 2006 and therefore doubling the sports income to £16 million within the three years. However the statement was incorrect because a 0.1% increase after three years would mean only a one sixth increase (16.6%). The promise turned out to be false because the levy fund actually decreased significantly over the next five years.

Droopys Scholes won the 2004 English Greyhound Derby and Like A Shot won the 2004 Irish Greyhound Derby. Charlie Lister won the Greyhound Trainer of the Year and Derby finalist, Arc, East Anglian Derby and Oxfordshire Gold Cup winner Fire Height Dan won the Greyhound of the Year.

Coventry opened under new management after an 18-year absence.

English Derby champion Farloe Verdict won the Scottish Greyhound Derby setting a new track record in the final. Brian Clemenson claimed his third successive Trainers Championship at Coventry. A brindle bitch called Roxholme Girl won the St Leger and the Gold Collar, the latter in a new track record time at the competition's new home of Belle Vue Stadium.

Trainer Tommy Foster retired from Wimbledon Stadium to concentrate on a small open race kennel and his son Jason joined Oxford Stadium.

Beatrice S. Levy

Beatrice Sophia Steinfelt Levy (April 3, 1892 - July 19, 1974) was an American printmaker and painter, draftsman, and instructor.<

She was born in Chicago to a German-Jewish emigrant father and a mother from Kentucky and grew up on Chicago's Near South Side. She studied at the Chicago Art Institute after graduating from high school in 1910 with an initial focus on illustration. While there, she was among a small number of students including Stanislaus Szukalski who defended the modernist works on display at the notorious Armory Show at the Art Institute in 1913. Encouraged by her instructors she continued her art education after graduating in 2010 with honorable mention, studying portraiture with Ralph Clarkson in Chicago, painting with Charles Hawthorne in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and fine print methods with Vojtěch Preissig in New York's Art Students League in 1915.

By then, she was already a prolific painter and printmaker, producing striking images with saturated color and abbreviated, semi-realist imagery. One of the earliest members of the Chicago Society of Etchers, her exacting, three-plate color intaglios were first exhibited by the Society in 1914. The same year, one of her prints received an honorable mention at Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco.

She held her first solo exhibition in 1916 at Goupil & Cie Gallery in New York, featured her entire collection of color aquatints. She had a studio in Chicago's 57th Street Art Colony.

In the 1920s she helped form an "art for art's sake" group called the Cor Ardens along with Szukalski, Carl Hoeckner, Ramon Shiva, and Gerrit Sinclair. Traveling with friends all over the United States, Europe, and Mexico, she was by then well-known for "forceful painting in oils, but also for her ability to express in the exquisite art of the copper plate … an individual style through a simple and dignified treatment of her subject matter." (Palos Journal, May 1929)

During the Great Depression (1929-39), Levy supervised the Easel Painting Division and Art Gallery of the Illinois Art Project of the WPA. She also supervised the Easel Painting Division for the Federal Arts Project a decade later.

For two years during World War II, Levy worked as a meteorological map draftsman and her subsequent work developed along more modern lines.

She traveled extensively in the US, Europe, and North Africa and summered La Jolla, California for several years before making it her home in 1950. She served on the board of the San Diego Museum of Art (then the San Diego Fine Arts Gallery) and taught at the La Jolla Museum School of Arts and Crafts (1961–62). Also at the time, she began a close relationship with the modernist artist Dorothy Stratton King, a La Jolla resident with whom she shared a passion for rich color and strong form.

Levy experimented heavily in her final decade in linear and highly abstract printmaking and enamels.

Levy never married. After a long and distinguished career, she died in La Jolla in 1974. Her papers are held by the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.

Ronn Pitts

Ronn Pitts (1933 - September 2013) was an american filmmaker who gained prominence through documenting civil rights actions in Chicago during the 1960s and 1970s. Pitts is a native of Bronzeville, Chicago. He is most notable for breaking the color barrier in Chicago's film industry, becoming the first black filmmaker to be hired by the NFL, and the first black professor hired in the film department at Columbia College. 

Pitts' filmmaking career began as a camera assistant for the local production company the Film Group. Film Group was an active commercial company, producing advertisements for United Airlines, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Aunt Jemima, and many others. Film group also made social documentaries, and this provided access for Pitts to meet many influential groups and figures associated with the civil rights movement. As a part of Film Group, Pitts worked on the influential "American Revolution 2," a documentary covering the riots and police brutality on display at the 1968 Democratic National Convention held in Chicago. Pitts also worked with Film Group on other such notable films as "The Murder of Fred Hampton" (1971) documenting the assassination of the leader of the Black Panther's Illinois chapter, and "Lord Thing" (1970), a film depicting the Chicago gang the Conservative Vice Lords, Inc. as a positive influence in the community"." 

Pitts would go on to break the color barrier in the white male dominated film industry by becoming the first black filmmaker to be hired by the NFL to document the Chicago Bears for 11 years along with his friend and fellow filmmaker Joe Stratton. While working for the Bears he captured footage of Detroit Lions wide receiver Chuck Hughes' death in the final minutes of a game agains the Bears in 1971. Pitts was also filming during the assassinations of Malcolm X and Harvey Milk - experiences which all had a profound impact on him throughout his life. 

Pitts was hired as the first black professor in the film department at Columbia College in 1971. Pitts was influential in transforming the Columbia College film program into a more diverse student body and with a sharper focus in on-location shooting. Pitts also taught industry seminars at the Community Film Workshop of Chicago, an organization committed to providing classes and resources to young filmmakers on Chicago's South Side.

Pitts was often recognized by the Chicago film community and the city of Chicago, receiving lifetime achievement awards from Columbia College and the Bronzeville Cultural Festival in 1998 and 2010 respectively, and having October 10, 1998 named "Ronn Pitts Day" by mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley.

<doc id="56580111" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56580111" title="Divertimenti for six winds (Mozart)">
Divertimenti for six winds (Mozart)

The divertimenti in F major (K 213), B-flat major (K 240), E-flat major (K 252/240a), F major (K 253), and B-flat major (K 270) are five companion compositions for pairs of oboes, horns and bassoons by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

The five wind sextets K 213, 240, 252/240a, 253, and 270 have historically been regarded as a series of five "Tafelmusik" (dinner music) works for the Salzburg court. In relation to this, the periodicity in the datings of January and July/August of the years 1775 to 1777, present on the autographs of four of them, is striking. If it is true that the pieces were written as "Tafelmusik" for the Archbishop of Salzburg, then there must have been specific and regularly recurring events every winter and summer accounting for this pattern; so far, though, none have been found. Even though in the "Anstellungsdekret für Joseph Fiala" [the decree of appointment for Joseph Fiala, currently in the "Landesarchiv Salzburg"], issued by the Archbishop on 1 November 1778, one reads "According to which we most graciously receive and welcome the supplicant into our service, subject to his good conduct, as first oboist, in order that the same, both in the Cathedral and at Court or elsewhere as we may require him, should participate diligently in the music and once again bring the wind instruments to that condition which they formerly had, so that they can perform at our command music with wind instruments at table [...]" no documents containing definite groups of musicians or concrete commissions for music have been found. The two summer datings of July and August could perhaps be linked to the semester holidays at the university at which time the students were responsible for the "Finalmusik" played at the summer residence of the Prince Archbishop, amongst others. For the two January dates, however, possible occasions of this kind have not been identified.

The sequences of keys within the group of five is also striking: F major/B–flat major/E-flat major for K 213, 240 and 252/240a, and F major/B-flat major for K 253 and 270. This two-fold occurrence of adjacent keys in the circle of fifths suitable for wind instruments may have been conceived with something of a pedagogical intention, most likely by Leopold Mozart. The apparent absence of an additional divertimento in E-flat major to complete a set of six (the usual number needed for publication) led early musicologists, including Alfred Einstein, to believe that the Divertimento in E-flat major K 289/271g was also part of the set, but the latter's authenticity is now in considerable doubt (see below). Within the five works the sequence of keys throughout the movements is quite regular. The slow movements (in K 252/240a this would be the Polonaise) are in either the dominant or subdominant key, while all the others are in the principal key. The "Trios" of the "Menuetti" are in the subdominant key, except for that of K 240 which is the related minor key.

The designation "divertimento" found on each of the autographs is in Leopold Mozart's hand. This and the fact that he numbered the pieces from I to V is a strong indication that he wanted to have the pieces printed. The five divertimenti were, however, never published during the Mozarts' lifetimes, perhaps due to the missing sixth piece. Interestingly, after Mozart’s death, Nissen changed the numbering fixed by Leopold and placed one of the divertimenti for ten winds, K 166/159d, in front of the sextets. Apparently, Johann Anton André was not misled by this and he published a very carefully prepared set of parts in the original order in 1801.

The Neue Mozart Ausgabe (NMA) quite rightly states that the five sextets have been underestimated in both the literature and musical practice: they are seldom performed in concert programs and the relevant literature usually mentions them only briefly without any detailed examination. This underestimation is most likely mainly due to the notion that, as mere "table music", the divertimenti are musically too superficial to deserve the attention the rest of Mozart's oeuvre does. Taking into account the restricted technical capabilities of the wind instruments featured here, these divertimenti can stand comparison with the Italian string quartets from the point of view of both compositional technique and richness of invention. The rich palette of tone colours associated with the oboes, horns and bassoons actually gives these works a particular sound not found in the works for strings. In addition, Mozart's five sextets are clearly superior to the analogous productions of his contemporaries.

These five divertimenti clearly comprise the second stage in Mozart's development as a composer of wind music, the first consisting of the two divertimenti for ten winds (K 186/159b and 166/159d), and the third of the large-scale serenades, K 361/370a, 375, and 388/384a, written in Vienna. The slightly gauche effects of K 186/159b and 166/159d, in which writing in thirds or sixths prevales, have been replaced in these five sextets by a greater mastery of the material which shows itself mainly in the considerably more developed independence of the six voices. Indeed, the first bassoon has been freed from its part as an additional bass instrument and has been transformed into a second solo voice.

The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated July 1775. The work consists of the following four movements:
This first sextet is the least sophisticated of the set. The "Allegro spiritoso" is in sonata form but the development section is quite brief. The subsequent "Andante" has a ternary structure and sees the first oboe paired with the first bassoon, and the second oboe briefly with the second bassoon. The "Trio" is a Ländler. The most important feature of the final "Contredanse en Rondeau" are the horns which are given the opportunity to shine as soloists on several occasions.

The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated January 1776. The work consists of the following four movements:
The opening "Allegro" is more elaborate than the corresponding movement in K 213 with a fuller second subject and a recapitulation starting in the middle of the first subject; the formal repetition of the operning statement is reserved for the very end of the movement. The "Menuetto" is quite striking due to the droning second oboe during the opening statement and the dotted rhythms the different voices seem to be teasing each other with during the repeat of this statement. The "Allegro" finale is in sonata form and more rhythmic than melodic, save for the gentle C minor second subject first presented by the first oboe and then repeated, an octave lower, by the first bassoon. According to the explicit indication in the autograph the horns in K 240 are "corni alti in B" ["high" horns in B-flat].

The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is undated; Wolfgang Plath deduced a date "probably between January and August 1776" placing it somewhere between K 240 and 253, but its date of composition cannot be fixed more precisely than this, even with the help of calligraphic examination. The work consists of the following four movements:
The third divertimento in the series sets itself apart from the other four by opening with a lazy "Andante" in 6/8 time with an unusual number of dynamic marks. In the "Menuetto" the first horn is prominently brought to the foreground; the subsequent "Trio" is in the solemn key of A-flat major. Polonaises rarely occur in Mozart's music (one interesting exception is a movement in the fifth divertimento of K 439b, for three basset horns); in K 252/240a the dance has an unusual swagger and a very brief "coda". The brilliant "Presto assai" is based on the Austria tune "Die Katze lasst das Mausen nicht".

The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated August 1776. The work consists of the following three movements:
The syncopated "Andante" theme of the initial movement could be a creation of Mozart himself and in the subsequent variations the composer entrusts solo tasks to all three pairs of instruments, including the horns. In the first, the first oboe present a broken-down version of the theme with limited contributions of second oboe and first bassoon. The second has the theme in the first oboe supported by a dialogue between second oboe and second bassoon in triplets. In the third, first oboe and first bassoon present the melody in octaves, while the fourth combines both oboes and both horns in the reworked theme with both bassoons in frantic 32nd-note figurations below. The fifth is the customary "Adagio" variation displaying a legato line and great clarity. The sixth constitutes the reprise of the "Andante" theme but played "Allegretto": at the end of the fifth variation the autograph mentions "variatio 6: il thema ma allegretto". The calm "Trio" contrasts the more noble and expressive "Menuetto". The ternary "Allegro assai" opens with a bold "unisono" statement and closes with a "coda".

The autograph is preserved in the Biblioteka Jagiellońska Kraków and is dated January 1777. The work consists of the following four movements:
The fifth and final divertimento is the most sophisticated of the set. The "Allegro molto" is in full sonata form with an interesting development section and a varied repeat in the recapitulation. The "Andantino" is a gavotte with a tiny but delightful three-beat canonic episode between first oboe and second bassoon at the beginning; the "coda" features four bars of Alberti-bass accompaniment for the first horn bringing the latter to prominence. The "Menuetto" carries the specific indication of "moderato" and features a peculiar hiccup in the second bar; the "Trio" is a Ländler. The "Presto" is an uncompromising 3/8 gigue featuring a brief moment of glory for the first bassoon in the "coda". Although the explicit indication is missing from the autograph the horns in K 270 are "corni alti in B" ["high" horns in B-flat].

K 289/271g comes down to us only via parts and score copies, all dating from the second half of the 19th century and attributed to Mozart, but no autograph is known. Based on its structure, however, it is highly unlikely that it was actually composed by Mozart: the decidedly obsolete writing seen from the many consecutive fifths and octaves, sometimes involving even the outer parts, the constant motion in parallel thirds and comparative lack of fantasy in the use of the horns, speaks against the authenticity of the piece. The NMA presents it as a work of dubious authenticity, and, most likely for this reason, it is generally not included in performances or recordings of the set of five.

She is a sessional lecturer in literature at the University of British Columbia and also runs workshops at the University of Arizona, and Douglas College. 

Her work has been published by "Geist, Canadian Literature, The Malahat Review, The Fiddlehead, Grain" and the "Colorado Review".

Jerome was born, and presently resides, in Vancouver, Canada. She received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Victoria and a Masters of Fine Arts in writing at the University of Arizona where she studied American Literature. She has two children from her marriage to fellow writer Brad Cran. The two were divorced in 2014. 

Jerome has taught poetry and literature at the University of British Columbia, the University of Arizona and Douglas College. Jerome has co-edited an oral history project in the Downtown Eastside, in association with an organization called Hope in Shadows Portraits of Our Community. She has published poems, essays, book reviews and two books of her own, Jerome has participated in judging the "Poetry in Voice" contest and the Vancouver Writers Festival. She teaches life writing workshops at the Post at 750 for people who are not considered professional writers but have something meaningful to say. She has also participated in the UBC's Robson Reading Series, as well as an event archive that was part of the literary series Open Word: Readings and Ideas at the University of Victoria, where she read from her past works and poems she was working on at the time.

Jerome's work contains themes of community, social commitment and neighborhood life. 

Gillian Jerome founded CWILA in 2012 as a response to what she saw as an unequal gender and representation in the literary community in Canada. CWILA produces an annual count of all participating publications and their number of books or reviews written by women, as well as how many women authors they have reviewed. CWILA strives to quantify the barriers that exist for women in literary culture, their findings aim at enabling discussion and inspiration for action in the literary community in Canada. The non-profit organization works to instill motivation in the literary and review community to create equal coverage and representation. In 2015 Gillian Jerome retired from her position at the Canadian Women in Literary Arts to focus on her other professions such as teaching and writing. 

"Geist" is a Canadian magazine that brings together fiction and non-fiction, poetry, essays, comics, reviews and photography. The magazine is explained as a mix of ideas and culture. Jerome taught writing workshops at "Geist" and is a participating editor and writer for the magazine. Jerome has published 14 works with "Geist", one recently published is called "What to Expect When You're Expecting." She has mainly published poetry and reviews of books with "Geist" and the themes that come up in her writing include but are not limited to; feminism, modern day motherhood, women's rights, politics, social justice and community.

In 2003 Pivot Legal Society started Hope in the Shadows, a photo contest in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. Pivot Legal Society asked participants to photograph things that were important to them, with the intent that this would give the participants a voice and recognition for their efforts. The initial contest led to the creation of a yearly calendar project where each year's winners are asked to share their story along with their image. This calendar is released in October of every year, they contain the winning photos of the participants chosen by local artists in the city. The calendars are sold through "Megaphones" vendor program which hires 200 people from low-income backgrounds each season, each vendor keeps half of their sales. There have been 75,000 calendars sold since 2003. 

In 2008 the book "Hope in Shadows" by Jerome and Brad Cran was released through Arsenal Pulp Press and the Pivot Legal Society that compiled 35 different stories attached to winning images from the photo contest. Their book took the stories associated with the winning photographs and expanded them with interviews of the photographers from the photo contest. They wrote about the traumas, abuse and mental illness which were reoccurring themes from the stories of the images in order to make known the life of the community. Part of the book focuses on First Nations people who survived residential schools, individuals coping with addictions, and others overcoming loved ones, this was done in hopes to bring awareness. "Hope in Shadows" was published in 2009 and soon after this date the calendar sold 5000 more copies. "Hope in Shadows" won the City of Vancouver Book Award, was shortlisted for the Roderick Haig-Brown Regional Prize, and was longlisted for the George Ryga Award for Social Awareness in Literature. 

Jerome has been teaching narrative, research writing and literature at the University of British Columbia since 2004 as a sessional lecturer (a Canadian rank similar to the United States adjunct professor) in the Department of English Language and Literatures.

Jerome was an editor and author for the "EVENT" magazine, this magazine has been publishing for 46 years in Western Canada. Event is published by Douglas College, a public post-secondary institution in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada. Jerome started working as Event's Poetry editor in 2010.

Georg Decker

Georg Decker (7 December 1818 – 13 February 1894) was an Austro-Hungarian portrait artist.

Decker was born in Hungary to a German-speaking family, and grew up and made his career in Vienna, where he taught painting as well as working as a portrait and historical artist. Thanks to his teaching, he was sometimes referred to as "Herr Professor Georg Decker".

Appointed as a knight of the Order of Franz Joseph, Decker has been called "a renowned portraitist of Vienna's highest society".

Decker was one of the sons of the artist Johann Stephan Decker and the brother of the artists Albert (1817–1871) and Gabriel Decker (1821–1855). He was born in Pest, in the Kingdom of Hungary, but in 1821 the Decker family moved to the imperial city of Vienna, where he grew up and was taught to draw and paint in watercolour and miniature by his father. As early as 1835, a drawing by Georg Decker of the composer Wenzel Müller was lithographed by F. Wolf. He began to exhibit watercolours in 1837 and in the early 1840s was accepted as a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, where he learnt to paint in oils. After that, Decker painted portraits in oils, and then from the 1850s also in pastels, having studied the work of Mengs and Liotard in Dresden and been captivated by the medium. Great success in this field soon followed. By 1860, Decker was conducting a private art school and in 1861 became a member of the Vienna "Künstlerhaus".

Outside the world of art, Decker was an active member of the Vienna Chess Company ("Wiener Schachgesellschaft") while Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild was its driving force.

In 1851 Decker married Ottilie von Sobek, who died in 1860. In 1861 he married secondly Josefine Helene von Lucam (1829–1914).

On his son's name day on 17 April 1869, the Emperor Franz Joseph presented the ten-year old Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria, with a portrait of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen, victor of Aspern, by Decker. In 1872, the Emperor rewarded Decker's achievements in art by giving him the Knight's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph.

When Decker died in 1894, the city of Vienna acquired a large number of sketches and portrait lithographs from his estate. He was buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery, and in 1909 a street in the Meidling district of Vienna was named "Deckergasse" in his honour, the mayor's year-book describing him as "the outstanding Viennese painter ("hervorragenden Wiener Maler") Georg Decker" and noting that "Deckergasse" was near "Canalettogasse". The "Deckergasse" crosses the Wilhelmsdorfer Park, which is also known as the Decker Park.

Manet Harrison Fowler

Manet Harrison Fowler (August 30, 1895 — February 1976) was an American musician, dramatic soprano, artist, voice coach, piano teacher and music educator. She was a child prodigy, giving piano recitals at the age of six. A native of Fort Worth, Texas she founded the Mwalimu School for the development of African Music and Creative Art in 1928 and relocated to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance. She was President of the Texas Association of Negro Musicians (TANM), the first state branch of the National Association of Negro Musicians.

Minnia (later respelled "Manet") Helen Harrison was born in Fort Worth, Texas, to Louisiana natives Taylor Henry Harrison, an African American and Carrie Vickers Harrison, a creole of African, French and Irish descent. She showed talent for music from an early age, playing piano at church from age six. Manet attended the Tuskegee Institute, and graduated in 1913. She pursued further studies in visual arts at The Art Institute of Chicago and in music at the Chicago Musical College and American Conservatory of Music. A well known painter of her time, she was also an opera singer performing around the country as a dramatic soprano.

Fowler taught music at Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College, and directed a church choir in Fort Worth. She was co-founder of the Texas Association of Negro Musicians in 1926, and she served on the board of the National Association of Negro Musicians, as scholarship committee chair, and edited its journal, "The Negro Musician". 

In 1928, she started the Mwalimu School. She moved the Mwalimu program to Harlem in 1932, where (as the Mwalimu Center for African Culture) it became a contribution to the Harlem Renaissance. Literary figures such as Carter G. Woodson taught at Mwalimu in Harlem. The school also offered a community kitchen, a library of works by black authors, and lessons from bodybuilding to comparative religion. The school's Mwalimu Festival Chorus performed often in New York, and made recordings, under Fowler's direction; they were called "one of the outstanding Negro choral groups in technical proficiency" by Alain LeRoy Locke.

In 1930, a pageant Fowler wrote, produced, and directed, "The Voice", was performed by over 2000 cast members at the National Baptist Convention in Chicago. She also wrote "Up From Slavery", and another musical piece, "African Suite". Several paintings by Manet Harrison Fowler are in the Juneteenth Museum in Fort Worth. A portrait she painted of her daughter Manet Helen Fowler is in the permanent collection at Yale University Art Gallery.

In 1972, Fowler was honored alongside Duke Ellington, Ramsey Lewis, Everett Lee, and Margaret Rosezarian Harris at the annual awards dinner of the National Association of Negro Musicians.

Manet Harrison married fellow educator Stephen Hamilton Fowler in 1915. They had five children, including Manet Helen Fowler, the first African American woman to earn a Ph.D in cultural anthropology in the U.S. and George H. Fowler, former Commissioner of the NYS Division of Human Rights and the first African American named to a cabinet rank by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. Manet Harrison Fowler was widowed in 1965, and died in 1976, aged 80 years, in New York. The Manet Harrison Fowler and Manet Helen Fowler Papers are archived together at the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Another collection of her papers is at Emory University.

Adam John Grandmaison, also known as Adam22, is an American podcast host, entertainer, YouTube personality, and the founder of the vlog and video interview podcast "No Jumper, The Coolest Podcast In The World".

Grandmaison was raised in Nashua, New Hampshire and was influenced at an early age by rapper Snoop Dogg, specifically the 1993 album "Doggystyle". Grandmaison graduated high school and later attended the University of Massachusetts Lowell, but dropped out before graduating. Before founding his website, "The Come Up," Grandmaison played professional poker online.

In 2006, Grandmaison started the website, "The Come Up," which became one of the most popular BMX websites of all time. Later, Grandmaison created On Some Shit, a BMX biking team and BMX-based clothing line which has a retail store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles.

Grandmaison hosted the inaugural Trap Circus music festival in Miami, Florida in 2017.

Started in 2015 initially as a BMX-centric podcast, Grandmaison's "No Jumper" podcast, hosted on YouTube, now focuses on interviews with underground rap artists. As of March 2017, the interviews received approximately 500,000 to 1 million streams each.

Grandmaison, through his "No Jumper" podcast, has been noted for interviewing up-and-coming talent as well as his extensive interviews with established rappers, and has interviewed Lil Yachty, Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, Ugly God, Tekashi69 and Action Bronson, among others. Hot 97 DJ Peter Rosenberg has said he views Grandmaison, "as an advance scout searching for combustible new talent," while "Rolling Stone" has described him as “underground hip-hop’s major tastemaker.” An April 2016 episode of "No Jumper" featuring Grandmaison's interview with still underground XXXTentacion has been credited with giving the Florida rapper exposure to a wide audience.

The "No Jumper" YouTube channel has over 200 million total video views and 1 million subscribers as of February 2018.

Jon Caramanica of the "New York Times" described "No Jumper" as ""The Paris Review" for the face-tattoo set."

Kevin Lokko

Kevin Adom Lokko (born 3 November 1995) is an English footballer who plays for National League side Dover Athletic, on loan from Stevenage.

Lokko began his career at Norwich City's academy, where he spent two years as an academy scholar and was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side during the 2012–13 season. He was released in May 2014 and joined Colchester United four months later, although injury meant he did not make any first-team appearances during his one season with the Essex club. Lokko gained his first experience of regular first-team football when he signed for National League side Welling United ahead of the 2015–16 season. He spent one year at Welling before joining another National League club in the form of Maidstone United in June 2016. After one season at Maidstone, Lokko signed for Stevenage in August 2017. He was immediately loaned to Dagenham & Redbridge before returning to Stevenage in February 2018, then joining Dover Athletic on loan later that month.

Lokko joined Norwich City's academy at the age of 15, signing a two-year deal as an academy scholar in the summer of 2012. He spent two years playing regularly for Norwich's U18 side and was part of the FA Youth Cup winning side during the 2012–13 season. Lokko was released by the club upon the expiry of his scholarship contract in May 2014. After being released by Norwich, Lokko went on trial at Colchester United in July 2014, playing in several U21 matches as well as in the first-team's final pre-season friendly ahead of the 2014–15 season. The trial period proved successful and Lokko signed a one-year deal on 19 August 2014, with the club stating he would join up with the U21 side. Although he began to train with the first-team, and was an unused substitute in two first-team matches in the opening months of the season, Lokko sustained a hip injury that kept him out of action for five months and did not make any first-team appearances during the season. He was released when his contract expired in May 2015.

Ahead of the 2015–16 season, on 20 July 2015, Lokko signed a one-year deal with National League side Welling United. The move came about after Lokko had played in the club's opening two pre-season fixtures and was offered a contract following the trial. He made his debut for Welling in the club's first game of the season on 8 August 2015, playing the whole match in a 1–0 victory over Guiseley at Park View Road. Lokko scored his first competitive goal in Welling's 2–1 home win over Woking on 28 March 2016, his first-half header proving decisive in helping Welling end their 23-game winless run. He was a mainstay in the centre of defence throughout the campaign, making 42 appearances in all competitions, scoring once,<ref name="Games played by Kevin Lokko in 2015/2016"></ref> in what would serve as Lokko's breakthrough season of regular first-team football. Despite Lokko's successful season, Welling were relegated back to the National League South after finishing in 24th place, and he left the club when his contract expired in May 2016.

Lokko subsequently signed for National League club Maidstone United on a free transfer on 3 June 2016. He rejected several offers from other National League sides prior to signing for Maidstone, stating he had "done his research" and was impressed by Maidstone's three promotions in four years under manager Jay Saunders. Lokko made his Maidstone debut in a 1–1 home draw with York City on the opening day of the 2016–17 season. He scored his first goal for the club at the end of that month, netting an injury-time winner in a 1–0 "smash and grab" away victory at Boreham Wood on 29 August 2016. Lokko scored twice in Maidstone's comfortable 4–2 win against Chester at the Gallagher Stadium on 18 February 2017, both of Lokko's goals coming in the first-half of the match. He also scored in another 4–2 home win two weeks later, this time against Southport. Lokko's goal was Maidstone's fourth of the match, he brought the ball down from a high free-kick and then swivelled before "sending a fine finish into the far side of the net". He was almost ever-present during his one season at Maidstone, making 46 appearances in all competitions and scoring four times.<ref name="Games played by Kevin Lokko in 2016/2017"></ref>

Four days before the start of the 2017–18 season, on 2 August 2017, Lokko signed for League Two side Stevenage for an undisclosed fee, joining the Hertfordshire club on a two-year deal. The move came about when Stevenage triggered a buyout clause in Lokko's contract after several other clubs had also shown interest in the player. Just two days after joining Stevenage, Lokko was loaned out to Dagenham & Redbridge of the National League on a season-long loan deal, in order for him to continue to gain first-team experience. Lokko made his Dagenham debut in the club's 2–1 home win against Barrow on 5 August 2017 and was awarded Man of the Match for his performance. He scored in consecutive games at the end of August in home fixtures against Ebbsfleet United and Bromley respectively. He was a regular in the centre of defence during his time at Dagenham, scoring two goals in 28 appearances in all competitions.<ref name="Games played by Kevin Lokko in 2017/2018"></ref> 

Lokko was recalled by Stevenage at the start of February 2018, with Stevenage chairman Phil Wallace revealing that several transfer deadline day deals gave the club the opportunity to recall Lokko and ensure he was "integrated in the squad on a daily basis ready for next season". He made his debut for the club as an 85th-minute substitute in the club's 3–1 away defeat at Forest Green Rovers on 13 February 2018. A week after making his Stevenage debut, Lokko was loaned out to National League side Dover Athletic for the remainder of the 2017–18 campaign, Stevenage retaining an option to recall Lokko after 28 days if necessary. He made his debut for Dover in a 3–1 away loss at AFC Fylde on 24 February 2018, coming on as a 77th-minute substitute in the match.

Lokko was called up to the England C team, who represent England at non-league level, for their two fixtures in May 2017. He made his England C debut on 28 May 2017, playing the full match in a 2–1 win over Panjab FA at Damson Park. Two days later, he once again played the whole 90 minutes in a 1–1 draw with Jersey FA.

Gretchen Peters (journalist)

Gretchen Peters is an American journalist and advisor. An expert on transnational organized crime, she is the author of "Seeds of Terror: How Drugs, Thugs, and Crime Are Reshaping the Afghan War". She is the executive director of the Center on Illicit Networks and Transnational Organized Crime, an operational think tank focused on the intersection between transnational organized crime and national security and the executive director of The Satao Project, a consulting firm that supports governments and industries to counter serious organized crime and corruption, and their convergence with terrorism, violence and social unrest.
Peters has a BA from Harvard University and a Masters in International Relations from the University of Denver's Korbel School of International Studies. At the Korbel School, she was the recipient of the Sié Chéou-Kang security and diplomacy fellowship and the Association of Former Intelligence Officers Life's Choices Foundation Scholarship.
Peters began her career as a journalist, helping to start the newspaper "The Cambodia Daily". For the following ten years, she covered Pakistan and Afghanistan, first for the Associated Press and later as a reporter for ABC News. Peters was nominated for an Emmy for her coverage of the 2007 assassination of Benazir Bhutto and won the SAJA Journalism Award for a "Nightline" segment on Pervez Musharraf.

Peters has conducted extensive research on the intersection between transnational organized crime and national security, from drugs and money laundering to wildlife and timber trafficking. Following the publication of her book, she advised U.S. military and diplomats in Afghanistan.

Peters was previously Senior Fellow on Transnational Crime at the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center at George Mason University, School of Public Policy. She also co-chaired an OECD Task Force working to improve policy approaches to fight the trafficking of wildlife and other environmentally sensitive goods. Peters serves on the Board of Advisors of the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

In 2015, Peters traveled to Africa with The Satao Project to study ivory supply chains in Tanzania and Kenya. Her work zeroed in on “a regional ecosystem moving ivory, drugs and guns … a matrix of different organisations that collaborate to move illegal goods along the Swahili coast.” She quickly identified the underlying problem: corruption. “If there’s a network that is moving illegal goods from one country to another, there are inevitably government officials involved, protecting them or looking the other way,” she said. Since then Peters has continued focus on the intersection of wildlife, narcotics, and U.S. national security interests, being cited in multiple articles, briefs, and documentaries.
In 2009 Peters published "Seeds of Terror: How Drugs, Thugs, and Crime Are Reshaping the Afghan War". In the book, Peters argues there is a deepening relationship between the Taliban and drug traffickers. "They start to look more like Tony Soprano and his guys than holy warriors," Peters said in an interview with CBS News. "They behave like criminals. They're involved in the drugs trade, human trafficking, kidnapping, gun running…all sorts of criminal activity." Peters spent five years researching the book, interviewing insurgents, drug kingpins, government officials, and poppy farmers. She discussed the book in a June 2009 appearance on the "Daily Show with Jon Stewart".

In 2010 Peters published a paper about the Haqqani network, a Pakistan-based militant group, with West Point’s Combating Terrorism Center and in 2012, Peters testified before the U.S. Congress about the Haqqani network.

Annamarie Saarinen (born January 11, 1960) is the co-founder and CEO of the Newborn Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that aims to accelerate the pace of early detection and intervention for treatable newborn health conditions.

In 2008, Saarinen’s daughter Eve was born with an undetected critical congenital heart defect (CCHD). At five days old, Eve went into heart failure, but was saved through a timely response by hospital staff. This experience inspired Saarinen to create the Newborn Foundation | Coalition with the purpose of making newborn heart screening standard practice of care in the United States. 
In 2011, under Saarinen’s leadership, the Newborn Foundation | Coalition successfully lobbied the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to include pulse-oximetry testing for CCHDs in their universal screening recommendations. As a result, 47 states and the District of Columbia have adapted these federal guidelines, with roughly 98% of U.S. newborns now being screened for CCHDs. 

Currently, Saarinen is leading the BORN project, a global health initiative leveraging pulse oximetry technology to combat neonatal mortality. The project is a targeted education-and-implementation initiative with the goal of bringing low-cost, effective screening tools and procedures to low-resource environments. To date, the project has successfully screened thousands of newborns across China and India.

Inland free-tailed bat

The inland free-tailed bat ("Mormopterus petersi") is a species of bat found in Australia. It is notable for being able to tolerate the most extreme body temperature range of any known mammal.

It was initially described in 1884 by Swedish zoologist Dr. Wilhelm Leche.
Leche had acquired the specimens used in his description from Gustav Schneider, a Swiss natural history dealer.
Leche initially placed it in the now-defunct genus "Nyctinomus" with the species name "petersi".
While Leche did not state the eponym for the species name ""petersi"", it is possible that it was named in honor of Wilhelm Peters, a German naturalist who described several species and genera of bats and had passed away a year prior to Leche's publication in 1884.
In 1906, Oldfield Thomas published a paper in which he considered "N. petersi" as synonymous with the southern free-tailed bat.
This status was largely maintained until 2014, when a study examining the morphology and genetics of the bats of Australia showed that it was distinct enough to be considered a full species.

In describing the species, Leche noted that it is similar in appearance to the east-coast free-tailed bat, "Mormopterus norfolkensis".
He wrote that it differs in its flat, compressed skull.
It is a small species of bat, with a head and body length of , a tail length of , and a forearm length of .
The tail extends approximately past the edge of the uropatagium.
Its tragus is tiny, at only long.
It weighs .

The inland free-tailed bat is nocturnal, roosting in sheltered places during the day such as tree cavities or under metal roofs.
Females have one breeding season annually, and give birth in November or December.
The litter size is generally one individual, with the young called a "pup."
This species of bat can tolerate the most extreme range of body temperatures of any known mammal.
Its body temperature has been recorded as low as and as high as .
This upper limit even exceeds recorded maximum body temperatures of camels.
These bats can survive these otherwise lethal extremes by using torpor, which is a physiological adaptation.

This bat is currently listed as least concern by the IUCN—its lowest conservation priority.
It meets the criteria for this assessment because it has a large geographic range; it tolerates a variety of habitats; its population size is thought to be large; and it is documented regularly throughout its range.
Its population may exceed one million individuals, although this number may be declining.
