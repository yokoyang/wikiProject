Wernerseck Castle

Wernerseck Castle (), also called the "Kelterhausburg", is a late medieval hill castle in the municipality of Ochtendung in the county of Mayen-Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It owes its name to its founder and lord of the castle, the Archbishop of Trier, Werner of Falkenstein (1388–1418). "Wernerseck" means "Werner's corner".

The ruins of the hill castle are situated above the River Nette at the foot of the Eifel mountains in the immediate vicinity of the Plaidt junction on the A 61 motorway. In the eastern part of the hill spur, on the narrowest part of which the castle was built, there was a Roman fortification in the Late Antiquity. The origin of this defensive position, which was probably conceived as a refuge fort, has been dated by coin finds to the first half of the 4th century. On the basis of pottery finds, it is assumed that the fort was used until the early 5th century.. Similar sites from the Late Antiquity along the Nette are found at Welling, Ruitsch and on the Katzenberg near Mayen.

The Trier prince-elector and archbishop, Werner of Falkenstein, began building the castle in late 1401 as part of his expansion policy in the Pellenz area. Thus, the site was not in the district of Ochtendung, which belonged to Electoral Trier, but in the feudal area of the counts of Virneburg. The castle was intended to act as a border fortress, guarding it against the principality of the Archbishop of Cologne. However, the castle never fulfilled this purpose, as the borders were realigned whilst it was being built. Later the castle was used as an administrative centre. Conrad Colbe of Boppard was probably appointed as the first "Amtmann" (bailiff) in 1412. From the 16th century onwards, the castle was enfeoffed to the lords of Eltz, who owned it until the 19th century. From 1966 to 1969 there was a falconry at the castle. A preservation society has set itself the task of securing and renovating the dilapidated castle and, between summer 2006 and November 2007, the tower house was renovated.

The pentagonal castle has round towers at three corners, whilst another corner forms the gate system. Its occupants lived in the 22-metre-high, four-storey, donjon (keep or tower house), which also had the normal function of a "bergfried" (fighting tower). It also contained the castle chapel. Access was via an elevated entrance. The tower house has unusually strong walls (2.5 metres thick) and its lower part has largely survived; the upper floors with their roof platform have become increasingly dilapidated and were repaired in 2007 by a preservation society. The castle is owned by the municipality of Ochtendung. It can be visited at any time, but can only be reached after a walk of about 2 km (from the town centre).
In the first construction phase at Wernerseck, the tower house was built as part of a simpleenceinte. The protruding bricks on the north side of the main tower, which used to join it firmly to a wall, can be seen as evidence of this. Furthermore, on the south and east side, there is a band of basalt stones in the brickwork, which could have been decoration on the outside of the castle. The curtain walls largely follow the line of the wall of the older, Ottonian castle, including its gateways. In a later extension, the surrounding wall was extended and provided with corner towers.

The remains of an older castle, which were used in the construction of Wernerseck, can be found in various parts of the castle and which have thus survived the ravages of time. The masonry at these points differs from the that of the later castle in that smaller slate stone was employed. Particularly noteworthy are the half of a gate system next to the tower house, part of the later inner gateway, and the remains of a building in the centre of the castle. Its predecessor probably followed the uninterrupted rocky hillcrest at that time and included the plateau in the area of the later outer bailey. Since there are no definitively dateable finds from the time before the new castle was built, its date of construction can only be estimated from the structural evidence. In the inner gateway, the remains of an older gateway have survived that is almost identical to that of the Waldschlössel at Klingenmünster. This suggests that the original castle should be regarded as an Ottonian build of the 10th to 11th century. There are no written records of the old castle, but it is not unreasonable to attribute its construction to the counts palatine of Laach.

Erebia dabanensis

Erebia dabanensis is a small butterfly found in the East Palearctic that belongs to the browns family.


debanensis Ersch. (37 f). Upperside dark black-brown, on the forewing a straight submarginal row of 4 round small black spots bearing black dots; before the margin of the hindwing there are as a rule 3, but rarely 4, such red-lnown spots, which are only very minutely or not at all dotted with black. The underside of the forewing grey-brown, with an obsolescent russet brown distal band, the ocelli of which have a somewhat lighter border. The apex and distal margin thinly dusted with white-grey. The underside of the hindwing is somewhat more densely scaled white-grey and has a but little darker dentate median band which is sharply defined in- and outwardly and bordered by a narrow whitish dentate line here and there on both sides. The ocelli which are situated in the somewhat lighter distal area are smaller than above, being sometimes altogether absent or replaced by small, hardly visible, black dots. Before the outer margin there is a submarginal band composed of small obsolescent brown spots. The female is lighter, more grey-brown, the ocelli of the hindwing are distinctly larger and on the underside of the hindwing of the same size as above. From East Siberia. — "tundra" Stgr. is smaller, the distal band of the upperside somewhat obsolescent, beneath broader and proxinially and distally sharply defined. The underside of the hindwing scaled white-grey, with dark brown, distally dentate, median band and liefore the distal margin a slightly dentate dark transverse line. Likewise from East Siberia. — "fletcheri" Elw. of which we know only the figure of the single sure female captured by Fletcher at 7500 ft. in the Altai Mts., is we think nothing but a specimen of "debanensis" in which the reddish yellow borders of the ocelli of the forewing are merged on both sides to form a broad russet band. On the hindwing the small ocelli are widely separated from one another. The median band on the underside of the hindwing is dark and somewhat prominent in "debanensis" , while in "fletcheri" it is of the same dark brown colour as the rest of the wing, so that only the edges of this band are visible as two finely dentate black curved lines. Found in July between Kurai and Bashkaus.

The larva feeds on "Festuca".

Laura Izumikawa

Laura Izumikawa Choi is a Southern California-based photographer who created a popular Instagram feed that features her daughter Joey often dressed in costumes as she sleeps during naps. Some of the photographs are published in the 2017 book, "Naptime with Joey."

Izumikawa was born in Tokyo. Her mother is Korean and her father is Chinese-Japanese. When she was 3 years old, Izumikawa's family immigrated to Southern California.

Izumikawa became interested in journalism and photojournalism while attending law school, where she had an interest in African international law. A 2007 trip to Rawanda inspired a career shift to photojournalism and photography.

Izumikawa works as a lifestyle and wedding photographer in Southern California. In 2016, while on maternity leave for her daughter, Joey, Izumikawa began taking pictures of infant Joey – who is a deep sleeper – as she napped in various costumes as a way to send fun pictures to family and capture her time as a baby. The costumes were for the most part made from materials found around the house or borrowed from friends. The photos were taken with an iPhone. The photos were meant to be images that could go in a baby book, but Izumikawa also posted the photos on Instagram, where they were very popular. Netflix posted the picture of Joey dressed up as Barb from "Stranger Things" and then "The Huffington Post" wrote about Izumikawa's feed and Joey went viral.

Many of the costumes feature different cultures from around the world and are sometimes sent in by fans. Some of the costumes are inspired by characters from movies and TV shows like "Star Wars" (Han Solo), "Princess Bride" (Inigo Montoya), "Game of Thrones" (Jon Snow), "Braveheart" (William Wallace), and "Stranger Things" (Barb). Some images feature the sleeping Joey wearing various outfits where she is a profession, like a baker, a sushi chef, or a Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter (Holly Holm), while others feature people from popular culture, like Sia, Beyoncé and DMC from Run-DMC.

In 2017, Izumikawa published the book "Naptime with Joey," which is a compilation of many of the photos on her Instagram feed.

Izumikawa's daughter, Joey Marie Choi, was born on April 20, 2016. She is three-quarters Korean and one-eighth Japanese and Chinese.

Izumikawa is married to Allen Choi, an optometrist. They live in Southern California with their daughter Joey. Izumikawa is Christian, and is active in her church.

Richard de Moravia

Richard de Moravia of Culbin or of Cubyn, was a Scottish nobleman famed for his victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Embo which took place in Sutherland, Scotland sometime between 1260 and 1270.

Richard de Moravia was either the cousin, or nephew, of Hugh or Hugo de Moravia, also known as Hugh Freskin, who was the first Lord of Sutherland and whose son was William de Moravia, 1st Earl of Sutherland (d.1284). Richard's brother was Gilbert de Moravia (d.1245) who was Bishop of Caithness.

Richard de Moravia received from his elder brother, Gilbert, all of the lands that Gilbert had received from Hugo Freskyn, (also recorded as Hugo de Moravia) and the charter was confirmed by Alexander II of Scotland. Richard was also given Skelbo Castle by his brother Gilbert in 1235.

William, Earl of Sutherland asked Richard de Moravia to engage a party of Danes (Vikings) who had landed at Littleferry, Sutherland until the Earl could come to his aid with a stronger force. The plan worked and the Danes were routed by the arrival of the Earl. However, Richard was killed during the battle. The Earl then arranged for Richard's body to be interred in Dornoch Cathedral and his damaged sarcophagus can still be seen there today. This was known as the Battle of Embo and took place sometime between 1260 and 1270.

Richard de Moravia had a son called Alan; whose son was Reginald; whose son was Gilbert. Gilbert married Eustachia, daughter of Kenneth de Moravia, 4th Earl of Sutherland. Their son was Walter whose daughter and heiress was Egidia de Moravia who carried the estates of Cubyn (Culbin) and Skelbol (Skelbo) into the Kinnaird family.

Richard de Moravia is also believed to have been the ancestor of the Murray of Aberscross family in Sutherland. The surname de Moravia meaning "of Moray" or "of Murray".

The Murray of Culbin coat of arms is recorded as "Sable, three stars argent".

The 1985 IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships was the third edition of the annual international road running competition organised by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF). The competition was hosted by the United Kingdom on 3 November 1985 in Gateshead and featured one race only: a 15K run for women. This was the first time that the distance was contested at the championships, having previously been a 10K run, and this was a permanent change. There were individual and team awards available, with the national team rankings being decided by the combined finishing positions of a team's top three runners. Countries with fewer than three finishers were not ranked.

The race was won by Portugal's Aurora Cunha in a time of 49:17 minutes, completing a successful defence of her title from 1984. Judi St. Hilaire of the United States finished eight seconds later in second place, while Great Britain's Carole Bradford came third for a second year running. As she had the year before, Bradford led the British women to the team title (alongside fifth place Paula Fudge and Wendy Sly in eleventh). The Soviet Union's team, featuring Lyudmila Matveyeva in fourth and two other top ten finishers in Mariya Vasilyuk and Yelena Sipatova, was just one point behind in the team race.

Corner Gas Animated

Corner Gas Animated is a currently running 13-episode Canadian animated television series, created and written by Brent Butt and David Storey. The series is an animated revival of the sitcom "Corner Gas" (2004–2009).

The series was announced in December 2016. It premiered on April 2, 2018.

The series will follow the everyday lives of the residents of the small town of Dog River, Saskatchewan. This series will be similar to the original, live-action series, but the creators have acknowledged that the animated format will give them opportunities to do stranger and more unrealistic things that the live-action version could not have depicted or filmed. For instance, cutaway gags in the animated version have included a "Mad Max" spoof and a gory fight between a Sasquatch and a unicorn.

All of the original "Corner Gas" actors will voice the same characters, with the exception of Janet Wright due to her death in 2016. Actress Corrine Koslo was selected to voice Emma Leroy in Wright's place.


The Comedy Network announced on April 9, 2018 that the premiere episode of "Corner Gas Animated", "Dry Bones" is the network's highest premiere in history. It drew in 360,300 viewers to date. It was the number one entertainment program on April 2nd in the demographics of A18-34, A18-49, and A25-54.

Madeline Tourtelot

Madeline Tripp Tourtelot (21 November 1915 – 26 May 2002 ) was a wealthy American artist and actress from the Chicago metropolitan area. She became a prominent female figure in the Chicago filmmaking community (collaborating with notable artists such as John Steinbeck, Emilio Fernandez, Harry Partch, and Edward Bland), founded three artist institutions in the Midwestern United States, and is included in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Born in Oakland, California as Madeline Hanson, Tourtelot moved to Evanston, Illinois as a young child. Growing up within a musical family (her father was a classical pianist) and close proximity to the galleries and museums in Chicago led Tourtelot to pursue post-secondary studies in fine art. She eventually studied at a number of institutions around the Midwestern United States including Smith College, Fish Creek Art Colony (where she studied painting under Vladimir Rousseff), Northwestern University, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Illinois Institute of Design, and the Saugatuck Summer School of Painting. Tourtelot married wealthy Chicago architect Edward Tourtelot in 1935 at the age of 19. The couple had two children: Edward Jr. (1936) and Joan (1938). Tourtelot died on May 26, 2002, after suffering from a stroke in 1984.

Tourtelot's filmmaking career began when she met John Steinbeck and Emilio Fernandez in 1947 while studying painting in Mexico. Steinbeck and Fernandez were working on the film version of Steinbeck's 1947 novel "The Pearl" and invited Tourtelot to help with production. She went on to become a significant contributor to Chicago's art scene and avant-garde filmmaking in the 1950s and 1960s, a member of Cinema 16, an influential membership film society in New York City, and a critic for Films in Review, in which her writing often revealed her own aesthetic preferences. In 1958, she produced "Windsong" with American composer Harry Partch, the first of six collaborations between the two and the only film in which she acted. Other works include "Rhythm on Canvas (1955), Reflections (1955), One by One (1955), The Poets Return (1962), and U.S. Highball (1968)."

Prior to working in film, Tourtelot was active in the fields of photography, printmaking and painting. Her painting "Escape" is in the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.

In addition to her visual arts practice, Tourtelot founded three art institutions: the Ephraim Art School (1943), the Gallery Studio in Chicago's North Michigan Avenue arts district (1950s), and the Door Harbor School of Art (1965), now known as the Peninsula School of Art, where she was the school's director until 1971.

One of Tourtelot's most well-known works, "Windsong", was produced in 1958. The work starred Tourtelot and artist Rudolph Seno, who at the time was a sculpture student at the Art Institute of Chicago's Saugatauk Summer school where Tourtelot was working. The film consists of playful shots that Seno and Tourtelot captured of one another on the sand dunes of Lake Michigan's southeastern shore, along with shots of local botanical speciment and water. The score for "Windsong", written by Harry Partch, was inspired by the playful imagery of Tourtelot and Seno, which reminded him of the legend of Apollo and Daphne.

Ekvtime: Man of God

Ekvtime: Man of God is a 2018 Georgian film directed by Nikoloz Khomasuridze and written by Lasha Kankava, Nikoloz Khomasuridze.

In February 1921, when the Soviet Red Army invaded independent Georgia, the government decided to collect all the treasury property and museum treasures and flee to France in emigration. They entrusted Ekvtime Takaishvili to collect the treasure and appointed him as a guard. The film's story is about hard life and activities of Ekvtime Takaishvili (actress - Rezo Chkhikvishvili), which mainly includes the history of the protection of the treasury in France during the emigration period in 1921-1945 and how Ekvtime Takaishvili returned it. The film is accompanied by the love story of Ekvtime and his charming wife and companion Nino Poltaratskaya (actress - Ana Tsereteli). Ekvtime himself defended the Georgian treasure from the world famous museums, rich collectors, court disputes, criminals and fascists to endure all the temptations and never deviated from the supreme moral principles and love of the Motherland, what is eternal in this world. In 2002 the Georgian Holly Church canonized Ekvtime Takaishvili and named him as „Man of God“.

Pellic Quest is a play-by-mail game that was published by Conflict Interaction Associates.

"Pellic Quest" was a licensed spinoff of Flying Buffalo's "Starweb", and is a mutli-player game in which each participant takes command of an entire alien race, jumping between worlds in search of galactic dominance.

Steve Jackson reviewed "Pellic Quest" in "The Space Gamer" No. 42. Jackson commented that "I'd recommend this to any "StarWeb" player who enjoys the original game and wants to try a variant - or to the tactics-oriented space gamer looking to 'get his feet wet' in PBM computer combat."

Karmelenberg

The Karmelenberg is a wooded cinder cone that was formed by volcanic activity. It marks the southeastern end of the East Eifel volcano field and rises to a height of , about 170 metres above the Pellenz region, and is visible from a long way off.

In the UNO Year of Mountains (2002), the Karmelenberg was Mountain/Hill of the Month in Germany. A monument records the proclamation on 21 June 2002.

As part of the Volcano Park (station 21), the hill is counted as a tourist attraction. Various information boards explain both its volcanic past as well as the history of St. Mary’s Chapel at the summit.

The hill is named after Mount Carmel in the Carmel massif, an important Biblical site and modern landmark in northwestern Israel.

The entire cinder cone of the Karmelenberg has been designated as a nature reserve.

The Karmelenberg belongs to the municipality of Bassenheim and is situated close to the Ochtendung junction on the A 48 motorway. Nearby is the Goloring, an important area monument. The Karmelenberg may be climbed from Bassenheim up a 1.5-kilometre-long avenue (natural monument ND-7137-386), from Ochtendung or from the L 52 from Koblenz to Polch.

The cinder cone of the Karmelenberg is part of a volcanic group with ten eruption centres that was active about 350,000 to 300,000 years ago. In addition to the Karrmelenberg main top, there are also the Schweinskopf and the so-called Oberholzgruppe, of which no trace is visible any longer. The Schweinskopf is almost completely levelled due to quarrying.

The Karmelenberg Group lies partly on the edge fault of the Neuwied Basin. On its north side, the Devonian bedrock of Hunsrück slates is about 100 metres down. On the south side lie riparian gravels of the Ur-Moselle. The three lava flows that emanated from the Karmelenberg are covered by pumice and loess.

The large quarry, which is still visible, was established in the 20th century. The high, vertical faces of the outcrop were produced by a special, high risk, quarrying technique known as "Hohlmachen" (“cave making”). At the foot off the rock face a low cave was hewn out and filled with wood. After blowing up the wooden props, large areas of the rock face collapsed to the ground.

The Karmelenberg Nature Reserve (NSG-7137-031) has an area of 10.74 ha. It was designated on 7 May 1981 by the Bezirksregierung Koblenz.

Its aim is the preservation of the Karmelenberg for scientific and cultural reasons due to its geological character including its outcrops, it habitat for rare and endangered wild flowers and plants and its natural beauty and uniqueness.

Peace of Mind (Breathe album)

Peace of Mind is the second and final studio album by English pop rock band Breathe. The album was released in August 1990 by A&M and Virgin Records.

Two years after the band burst onto the American scene with the hits "Hands to Heaven" and "How Can I Fall" from "All That Jazz" (1988), the album brought the group back to the charts with two more singles. Reviews were mixed, praising lead singer David Glasper's strong, soulful voice, while some dismissed the album itself as a bit too seamless and proper.

"Peace of Mind" peaked at #116 on the US "Billboard" 200, while the singles "Say a Prayer" and "Does She Love That Man?" both reached their highest peaks in the US Adult Contemporary charts at #3 and #17, respectively. "Where Angels Fear" would later be covered by American Contemporary Christian artist Clay Crosse under the title "Where Angels Dare".

The 1986 IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships was the fourth edition of the annual international road running competition organised by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF). The competition was hosted by Portugal on 9 November 1986 in Lisbon and featured one race only: a 15K run for women. There were individual and team awards available, with the national team rankings being decided by the combined finishing positions of a team's top three runners. Countries with fewer than three finishers were not ranked.

The race was won by Portugal's Aurora Cunha in a championship record time of 48:31 minutes, completing a successful defence of her titles from 1984 and 1985. Her teammate Rosa Mota finished four seconds in arrears for second place, narrowly pushing Carla Beurskens of the Netherlands in the bronze medal spot by a margin of one second. The Soviet Union won the team race, courtesy of Tatyana Kazankina, Lyudmila Matveyeva and Marina Rodchenkova, who all finished in the top ten. Cunha and Mota were joined by Albertina Dias to bring Portugal second in the team rankings, two points clear of the Marty Cooksey-led American team.

<doc id="56559080" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56559080" title="Jim Alexander (photographer)">
Jim Alexander (photographer)

Jim Alexander (born August 7, 1935) is an American documentary photographer, photojournalist, activist, and teacher who is best known for being a “Participant Observer” and his photographs of human rights and black culture. In 1995, he was the first artist selected in the annual “Master Artist” program conducted by the City of Atlanta Office of Cultural Affairs. He would later be inducted into "The HistoryMakers" in 2006"."

Alexander was born on August 7, 1935, in Waldwick, New Jersey as one of 12 children to auto mechanic David Alexander, and Frances James Alexander. He attended Waldwick Public School and Ramsey High School. He grew up during a time where the opportunities for Blacks in America to economically advance were few.

In 1952, Alexander joined the U.S. Navy at the age of 17. During his time in Naval boot camp in Bainbridge, MD, one event would help shape the course of his entire life; Alexander won his first camera, a Kodak "Brownie Hawkeye" in a friendly dice game. Immediately putting his new camera to use, Alexander sold photographs to the other sailors for fifty cents each.

Once he finished boot camp, he was transferred to a naval base in Charleston, S.C. to begin training as a diesel engine-man. While in Charleston he asked the naval base photographer to look over some of his work, and he began teaching him about 35mm and large format photography. After leaving the Navy in 1956, Alexander put photography on hold for several years. He managed a pool hall and detailed cars. He lived above the pool hall, which was called a rooming house. The rooms were rented for $9 a week. That room and tiny bed became Alexander's home during what he called his "street time."

In 1964 he moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey from Paterson where he lived following his discharge and launched his professional career as a freelance photographer. Alexander completed courses for a certificate in business organization and management at Rutgers University, while he worked as general manager of a newspaper delivery service. He also enrolled at New York Institute of Photography (NYIP) and earned a degree in commercial photography in 1968.

Being at the height of the human rights movement, Alexander started documenting local and national responses to the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination in 1968. His photographs included: marches, rallies, conferences, meetings, festivals, concerts, and Black life as a whole. He entitled the body of work "Spirits/Martyrs/Heroes." The collection ranges from the 1960s to the present. It encompasses a variety of subjects from the human and civil rights movement, politics, music, art, and everyday individuals who were consistent in their pursuit of equality.

On a bus trip from Ridgewood, New Jersey to New York, Alexander met Eric Maristany. They both were traveling with cameras, so conversation between the two sparked. Maristany worked at a filmstrip company in Ridgewood and invited Alexander to visit the studio. After visiting the studio a few days later, he was able to meet the staff and owner who produced the educational filmstrips on the civil rights movement. He then volunteered at the studio for several days. After gaining the respectability of a documentary photographer, Alexander got hired at Bruner Productions in 1968 to shoot filmstrips of the civil rights movement until 1970.

Alexander is also known for his document of Black inspired music, prominently jazz and blues. When he photographed different events, he realized that the event would open with a musical selection. He started to appreciate the influence music had on the African American community, and it revealed the importance of musicians. "I am just a lover of music. There was a lot going on in the '50s and '60s, in New Jersey, where all the little clubs or corner bars had a trio or quartet playing. I was really listening to the music." He then decided he would incorporate black music in his work. In 1988, Alexander curated his own exhibit entitled "Blues Legacy" for the first National Blacks Arts Festival.

He curated the "Duke and Other Legends: Jazz Photographs" by Jim Alexander that same year. The exhibit featured 50 classical jazz musicians that toured 13 southern cities through a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Southern Arts Federation. The resilience and creativity of African American culture captivates the world whether it is through music, art or the written word. Jazz music is just one example of the beauty birthed by African Americans in spite of the hatred and marginalization that was designed to break their spirits. Alexander juxtaposed images of the ugly barriers created by hatred as well as the elegant strength of those who dare to shatter them. He has spent years documenting jazz musicians such as Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, and Count Basie just to name a few.

Alexander met and became friends with documentary photographer Gordon Parks in 1968. Parks was influential in the direction of his photographic career. "A photo can be taken to build, or it can be taken to destroy, and that decision rests in the hands of the photographer." Alexander recognized how his photographs could affect the awareness of the subject and the viewer.

Moved to dedicate ten years of his life and work to documenting human rights and the Black experience; he shared this intention with Parks. Parks said, “that sounds good James, but your ass is going to starve; nobody is going to pay you just to run around shooting anything that interests you.” So Alexander decided to teach others the art of photography while shooting documentary work on the side. Parks approved his decision and told him, “That sounds better." Fifty plus years have surpassed since having that conversation with the late Gordon Parks, and Alexander continues to document the struggle amongst Black lives.

Alexander believes that each photo contains burrows that sends a message deep into the viewer’s conscious. His photos have the aesthetic of a participant observer. As described by Alexander, "a participant observer acknowledges the undeniable influence of his mere presence, while pleading allegiance to the role of the spectator." Alexander’s images help call attention to gross violations of human rights in the United States over the course of many decades.

Alexander has mentored and taught photography at various colleges and universities such as Yale University, Emory University, Fulton County Arts Council, TRIO and Upward Bound Programs at Clark College (better known as Clark Atlanta University), Morris Brown College, and Atlanta Metropolitan College.

In 1970, Alexander was hired as a consultant and photography instructor for Yale University’s School of Art and Architecture’s Black Environmental Studies Team (B.E.S.T) and The Black Workshop. He also served as executive director of a community arts organization from 1972 to 1976.

Atlanta became home to Alexander and his family in 1976 after he accepted a position as the director of audiovisual communications for the Atlanta Office of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives. This was a non-profit established to save, protect, and expand the landholdings of Black family farmers in the south.

At Clark College (better known as Clark Atlanta University), Alexander served as Photographer-in-Residence from 1984-1990. During his time at Clark Atlanta, Alexander established a mentoring program where he helped students who worked with the campus newspaper, yearbook, and various types of photography. He also documented the consolidation meetings and events up until the historic ribbon cutting for the AUC/CC CAU merger.
The Neighborhood Arts Center (NAC) originated in 1975, and became the heart of Atlanta's Black Arts Movement. The center was constructed in the image of Atlanta's first African American Mayor, Maynard Jackson. In 1977, Alexander became the photographer in residence at The NAC. He was proactive in maintaining the historical values The NAC instituted. Alexander was able to document Romare Bearden, a legendary artist, and author. 

As a strong believer in “art for people’s sake,” Alexander established an organization called, Freedom Arts Communications Team (F.A.C.T.) in 1972. F.A.C.T. was a collective of artists; musicians, visual artists, poets, media professionals, community advocates, theater group members, and mentors. By launching a community arts festival, working with schools, the Police Athletic League and community development offices, they created a visiting artist program to serve youth and adults in the New Haven, CT area. 

From 1996 - 1999, Alexander was a coordinator and instructor of the youth photography program called “As Seen by Teens” photography and journalism program. "As Seen by Teens" was a summer photojournalism program designed to give young students a better sense of themselves and their communities. Implemented by Nexus Contemporary Art Center, the program encouraged creativity while it challenged students to learn and show self-respect, achieve goals, and gain a marketable skill.

The love for education, reading, and black culture led Alexander to be a co-founder of First World Bookstores in Atlanta, GA during 1988. The store specialized in predominately African American books, gifts, and art; which eventually expanded to five bookstores in the metropolitan area until 1994.

While in New Haven, CT Alexander opened a photo studio, "Jim-Alex Studio Gallery" in 1971. He exhibited the works of other photographers as well as his own. The studio became a meeting place and hub for artists and activists of all kinds. Community meetings were frequently held there, and The Connecticut Black Media Coalition was established at his studio. Alexander jokes, “Everything happened in my studio but photography.”

Alexander has been instrumental in the founding of several organizations of professional photographers, including the "Photographers’ Collective", "the Atlanta Photographers Group", and "Zone Three". He is a founding member and past executive vice chairman of the "National Black Media Coalition" and completed two terms as president of "African Americans for the Arts", (AAFTA).

Henri Burin des Roziers

Henri Burin des Roziers, O.P. (February 18, 1930 - November 26, 2017), was a French Dominican priest and lawyer, who spent forty years working with and defending Brazilian peasants forced into labor or harassed by wealthy landowners. Landowners repeatedly threatened his life in an attempt to stop this work. In Brazil, he was known as "counsel for the landless". 

Born February 18, 1930 to an upper middle class family, Burin des Roziers obtained degrees in literature from the Sorbonne, comparative law from the University of Cambridge, and in 1957 a doctor of law at the Faculty of Law of Paris.

While at Cambridge Burin des Roziers met the Dominican Yves Congar, who had a profound influence on him. Burin des Roziers entered the Dominican order in 1958 and after ordination as a Dominican priest 1963, he worked as a chaplain with law and economics students in Paris. Burin des Roziers became close to and worked with the Dominican and worker-priest Jean Raguenès. In 1970 he began work as a social worker in Annecy (Hautes-Savoie), working particularly with Tunisian immigrants.

In 1978, Burin des Roziers left for Brazil, where he became a lawyer for the landless people who lived at the edge of the Amazon rainforest.

Burin des Roziers was instrumental in helping more than 50,000 people who worked in forced labor for wealthy landowners who controlled the majority of rural lands. In 2000, as a lawyer for the Pastoral Commission of the Earth in the State of Pará, Burin des Roziers received death threats from a fazendeiro, one of the wealthy hacienda owners (latifundists), who was also responsible for the assassination of a union leader. 

In 2005, after the assassination of the American missionary Dorothy Stang, Burin des Roziers was again threatened with death, as were many trade unionists and religious advocates who worked with the poor. A contract was placed against him by the fazendeiros, for 50,000 reals, or 20,000 euros.

As a result of his work, Burin des Roziers received the Legion of Honor in 1994, and the Ludovic-Trarieux international human rights prize in 2005. 

Burin des Roziers reluctantly left Brazil in 2014 after suffering three strokes and died from natural causes in Paris on November 26, 2017 at the convent of Paris Saint-Jacques.

Cadmus (1813 ship)

Cadmus was launched in 1813 at Sunderland. She traded with the East Indies under license from the British East India Company (EIC) until 1827. Then between 1827 and 1834 she made two voyages as a whaler. She was lost in 1835.

"Cadmus" first appears in "Lloyd's Register" in 1813 with the little information beyond her burthen and place of launch. After a voyage to Jamaica, "Cadmus" started trading with the East Indies, primarily to Île de France, but also on to Bombay or Bengal. For instance, Captain J. Dent sailed in December 1817 for Bombay. Equally, Captain R. Appleby sailed on 28 February 1819 and on 5 April 1821 for Fort William, India.

In 1827 T. Sturge & Co. started to use "Cadmus" as a South Sea whaler.

Whaling voyage #1 (1827-1830): Captain Snowden sailed from England on 11 November 1827, bound for Timor. In April 1829 "Cadmus" was near Timor. Then, by March 1830 she had moved to the Bay of Islands and was whaling there. She returned to England on 4 August 1830 with 450 casks of oil.

Whaling voyage #2 (1830–1834): Captain Snowden sailed from England on 24 December 1830, bound for the Pacific Ocean. On 27 August 1831 "Cadmus" was off Ocean Island. She then sailed to Christmas Island. On 4 April 1832 she was near Guam.

On 21 March 1833 "Cadmus" was at Sydney, New South Wales, with 112 tuns of sperm oil. "Cadmus" left on 9 May. 

On 3 July 1833 Snowden passed on the news to "Cheviot" that the whaler had been lost on the coast of the Seychelles.

By one report Snowden landed 14 mutinous crewmen on the Bonin Islands. He had engaged some of them at Sydney. However, another report states that "Cadmus" was at the Bonins between 22 and 23 August, and that the 14 men that had been landed against the wishes of the inhabitants, had come a month earlier from "Harriet", Bunker, master.

On 17 November 1833 "Cadmus" was at Oahu. Then she was reported to have been at the Bay of Islands on 13 March 1834, and homeward bound. She returned to England on 15 October 1834 with 98 tons of oil.

"Cadmus" was wrecked on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, on 30 November 1835. She was on a voyage from Quebec City, Lower Canada to Poole, Dorset, or Prince Edward Island to Haiti.

1987 IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships

The 1987 IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships was the fifth edition of the annual international road running competition organised by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF). The competition was hosted by Monaco on 21 November 1987 in Monte Carlo and featured one race only: a 15K run for women. There were individual and team awards available, with the national team rankings being decided by the combined finishing positions of a team's top three runners. Countries with fewer than three finishers were not ranked.

The race was won by Ingrid Kristiansen of Norway in a championship record time of 47:17 minutes, breaking Aurora Cunha's three-year winning streak (the Portuguese was twelfth here). In a dominant display by the Norwegian, the runner-up Nancy Tinari (Canada) was over a minute and a half behind, while third-placer Maria Curatolo of Italy arrived nearly two minutes later. The team competition was won by Portugal (their first team title), led by Albertina Machado in sixth with Cunha and Conceição Ferreira in support. The Soviet Union took second place with a team of Yekaterina Khramenkova, Lyudmila Matveyeva and Marina Rodchenkova – though they matched Portugal on 32 points, they lost out on merit of a slower combined time. Great Britain was third in the team rankings, led by Paula Fudge.

In 2017, it became clear that Máté Bodor, due to his obligations under Alestorm, could not go on tour with Leander Kills. András Vermes joined the band later on. Köteles has said that the band would later regard Máté Bodor as an honorary member, expecting him on future recordings, and, if his time allows, during the concerts.

Leander Kills participated in A Dal 2017, the 2017 edition of the Hungarian national selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest, with the song "Élet", with which they made it to the final. On 6 December 2017, it was announced that they would compete again in the 2018 edition of A Dal, for the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal with the song " Nem szól harang".

Metopolophium dirhodum

Metopolophium dirhodum, the rose-grain aphid or rose-grass aphid, is a species of sap-sucking insect in the family Aphididae found worldwide. Its primary host is rose, and its secondary host is a grass, including cereals such as wheat, barley, oats and rye. It is an important vector of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) which causes serious reductions in yields of affected crops.

The rose-grass aphid has an almost cosmopolitan distribution, being found in most parts of the world where its secondary hosts are grown. It was first detected in New Zealand in 1982.

Wingless adults are between long, slender, glossy yellowish-green with a darker dorsal stripe. The antennae, legs and siphunculi (erect, backward-pointing tubes on the abdomen) are relatively long and pale in colour. Winged individuals are between long and a uniform green colour.

The species overwinters on rose, its primary host, as an egg. On hatching in the spring, rose-grain aphids feed on rose at first, but do not persist on it beyond about June in the northern hemisphere, dispersing to grasses and cereal crops in midsummer. On its primary host, it is less harmful than is the rose aphid ("Macrosiphum rosae"), but in some years the plants may be littered with white nymphal cases and large numbers of winged females may develop in late spring and migrate in "clouds" to its secondary hosts. Cereals that are used by this aphid as their secondary hosts include wheat, barley, oats and rye. Research in New Zealand showed that barley and oats were more affected by this pest than was wheat, possibly because the lower leaves of wheat, on which the aphids tended to congregate, became senescent early in the year, giving conditions unsuitable for the further growth of the aphid.

Symptoms shown by the host plant include abnormally coloured and contorted foliage, deposits of honeydew with subsequent growth of sooty mould, yellowing of foliage and early senescence. This aphid is one of the most important vectors of the barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV).

Disentangling Old Percy

"Disentangling Old Percy" is a short story by English comic writer P. G. Wodehouse and one of seven stories featuring the fictional character Reggie Pepper. It was published in the US magazine "Collier's Weekly" on 30 March 1912 as "Disentangling Old Duggie". The story was published in "The Strand Magazine" in the UK in August 1912 as "Disentangling Old Percy".

In the story, Reggie Pepper wants to help his pal Percy Craye when Percy's overbearing sister Florence Craye disapproves of Percy being engaged to a palm reader.

The well-meaning young gentleman Reggie Pepper advises his friend Percy Craye to consult a palmist named Dorothea. Though initially reluctant, Percy is ultimately happy after meeting Dorothea, who is really a widow named Mrs. Dorothy Darrell. Percy makes money after being encouraged by her optimistic reading and thinks she is wonderful. Three weeks later, Florence Craye, Percy's older sister, tells Reggie that Percy is engaged to the palmist. Florence is class-conscious and strongly disapproves of the match.

Hoping to help Percy, Reggie suggests that if Florence acts as if she approves the match and invites Percy and Dorothea to the family's country house, Percy will realize that he does not belong with Dorothy and will end the engagement. Florence likes the idea and tells Reggie to come to the house with Percy and Dorothy. Reggie informs Percy about the plan; Percy is confident that his love for Dorothy will prevail.

At the Crayes' country house, Percy really does change his mind about the engagement under Florence's influence, and Dorothy leaves for London. Back in London, Reggie sees Percy's older brother Edwin, Lord Weeting, who is unusually happy. Florence is upset after learning that Edwin has been spending time with Dorothy, and orders Reggie to talk to Dorothy. Reggie learns from Dorothy that she is becoming close to Edwin to get revenge on Florence, though she is also genuinely helping Edwin learn to enjoy life after being oppressed by Florence. Dorothy does not deny that she is engaged to Edwin. Florence commands Reggie to tell her widowed father, Mr. Craye, Lord Worplesdon, that Edwin is engaged to a palm reader.

Reggie goes to Worplesdon's club and tells him that Edwin is engaged to a palmist, but Worplesdon does not seem to disapprove. Edwin arrives, and Worplesdon sees that Edwin is happier than before. Worplesdon and Edwin have fun in London. To avoid Florence, Reggie goes to Nice in France. He is surprised to find Edwin there, enjoying himself. He also sees Dorothy, who became friends with Lord Worplesdon after helping Edwin enjoy life. Dorothy says that she hopes someday to win Florence over because she wants all her children to love her. This confuses Reggie. Dorothy explains that she considers Lord Worplesdon's children her own since she married Lord Worplesdon.

The British version of the story, "Disentangling Old Percy", takes place in London, while the American version of the story, "Disentangling Old Duggie", is set in New York. Reggie Pepper's friend is named Percy Craye in the English version and Douglas or "Duggie" Craye in the American version. Another difference is that, in the British version, the elder Craye has the title "Lord Worplesdon" and Edwin is "Lord Weeting", while in the American version, the family lives near Philadelphia and is not part of the British peerage.

The American version of the story, "Disentangling Old Duggie", was illustrated by Wallace Morgan in "Collier's". The British version, "Disentangling Old Percy", was illustrated by Alfred Leete in the "Strand". This version with Leete's illustrations was reprinted in the UK in the periodical "Newnes Summer Annual" in 1915. In October 1934, "Disentangling Old Percy" was published in "Golden Book Magazine" in the US.

The American edition of the story, "Disentangling Old Duggie", was featured in the collection "Enter Jeeves", published in 1997 by Dover Publications. This collection includes all the Reggie Pepper stories and several early Jeeves stories.

"Disentangling Old Percy" was collected in the 1929 anthology "The Legion Book", published by Cassell. "Disentangling Old Duggie" was included in the 1959 anthology "A Cavalcade of Collier's", published by A. S. Barnes.

List of Soulfly members

Soulfly is an American heavy metal band from Phoenix, Arizona. Formed by vocalist and rhythm guitarist Max Cavalera following his departure from Sepultura in 1997, the group originally included lead guitarist Jackson Bandeira, bassist Marcelo "Cello" Dias and drummer Roy "Rata" Mayorga. Bandeira left after the recording of the band's self-titled debut album, with former Machine Head guitarist Logan Mader taking his place in April 1998 for the album's touring cycle. Mader had left by the following January, with Mikey Doling joining in his place. Mayorga departed the group in July 1999, with Joe Nunez announced as his replacement in November. Nunez performed on the 2000 album "Primitive", but left the following October due to concerns with his "financial arrangement with the group". Mayorga returned in his place.

In September 2003, Dias was fired from Soulfly by Cavalera and his wife Gloria (the band's manager), which prompted Doling and Mayorga to leave. The departed members were quickly replaced by returning drummer Nunez, Primer 55 guitarist Bobby Burns on bass, and former Ill Niño guitarist Marc Rizzo. The group's lineup subsequently remained stable for a number of years, before Burns left in July 2010, shortly after the release of "Omen". Fireball Ministry's Johny Chow filled in for a string of tour dates, before Tony Campos (formerly of Static-X) joined as Burns' full-time replacement in 2011. Shortly after Campos' addition, Nunez left Soulfly and was replaced temporarily by Cavalera's son Zyon. Borknagar's David Kinkade subsequently joined in September, performing on the group's eighth studio album "Enslaved".

Kinkade played his final show with Soulfly on October 23, 2012, when he decided to retire from music. Zyon Cavalera subsequently returned to the band in Kinkade's place. In May 2015, Campos left Soulfly to join Fear Factory, with Havok's Mike Leon taking over a few months later.

Mortuary Chapel, Royal Hospital for Sick Children

The Mortuary Chapel of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh is a nineteenth century chapel, designed by the Scottish architect George Washington Browne, with mural decorations by the Arts and Crafts artist Phoebe Anna Traquair. The chapel is designated as a "Category A" listed building by Historic Scotland. The murals are Phoebe Traquair's first professional commission, and the sole survivor of around 20 commissions instigated by Patrick Geddes' Edinburgh Social Union. They were described in 1887 as "the most important and memorable portion of the art of the Social Union" and in an August 1891 letter to her nephew, Traquair says "I myself believe that in some ways I shall never do better or maybe as well".

The original mortuary chapel was located at the Lauriston Lane site of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. 

In April 1885, Traquair was approached by the Edinburgh Social Union and asked if she would decorate a converted coalhouse on the original hospital site at Lauriston Lane, now to be used as a mortuary chapel. The building was small, only 3-metres by 4-metres, but the hospital ladies committee hoped that it could become “a suitable place where the bodies can be left reverently and lovingly for the parents before the burials”. As a mother of three children herself, Traquair was happy to accept the commission.

The decorations were completed in 1886 and strongly reflect themes of motherhood and the redemption of mankind. In a time when as many as 8% of children did not live to see their first birthday, Traquair aimed to offer comfort and support to grieving parents through her decoration scheme. In style she draws on interpretations of medieval illuminated manuscripts and Eastern Orthodox imagery, in a mixture of realism and Symbolism. A review in the Scottish Art Review by Gerald Baldwin Brown in 1889 refers to the murals as “...a piece of illumination enlarged”. 

In 1891, the Sick Children’s hospital moved to a new site at Rillbank in Sciennes and the little chapel was abandoned. The second chapel was built as part of Washington Browne's overall design for the hospital and is a single storey building in red sandstone located at the northeast corner of the main hospital building.

Although the old hospital site had been acquired by the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh the murals were at risk of slow destruction as the chapel was no longer being used. Then, thanks to a petition led by Traquair herself, in 1894 some of the murals were successfully transported to a new purpose-built mortuary chapel. There were significant technical and logistical difficulties; indeed some of the panels were moved and installed still attached to the bricks of the old building. As the new mortuary was larger than the original, panels from the first scheme were repaired, surrounded with fresh plaster, and the spaces filled with an enlarged decoration scheme. Although the two schemes are united by their use of colour, the second scheme deliberately uses a simpler and more childlike manner. 

The mortuary chapel remains in use within the Sick Children’s Hospital, though curtains have been installed so that the murals can be covered when required, as the religious themes reflected in the images are not always appropriate.

In September 2017, the Royal Hospital for Sick Children was sold to property developers, including the Mortuary Chapel.

The rivière du Milieu ("English: river of the middle") is a tributary of Poutrincourt Lake, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, into the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Quebec, Canada.

The Milieu River runs successively in the townships of Buade and Poutrincourt. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.

Forest Road R0212 (East-West) intersects the middle of the river. While the forest road R0223 serves the Valley of the Marquette River West, on the west side of Poutrincourt Lake. This last road connects to the Northeast at route 167 linking Chibougamau and Saint-Félicien, Quebec. The Canadian National Railway runs along this road.

The surface of the Milieu River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

The toponym "Rivière du milieu" was formalized on March 28, 1972 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec..

In Canada, it was released as "Encores" on Capitol Records.

In his retrospective review for AllMusic, Greg Adams described "Weekend in London" the band's own songs in the album "vacillate between the pretty Beatlesque pop of "Your Turn to Cry" and moody rockers similar to early Zombies" and that as the band released three album around that time, "Weekend in London sounds like they were being stretched a little too thin."

The competition was hosted by Brazil on 24 September 1989 in Rio de Janeiro and featured one race only: a 15K run for women. There were individual and team awards available, with the national team rankings being decided by the combined finishing positions of a team's top three runners. Countries with fewer than three finishers were not ranked.

The race was won by Wang Xiuting of China, who had been runner-up to Ingrid Kristiansen the previous year. She ran 49:34 minutes to finish ten seconds ahead of the runner-up, teammate Zhong Huandi, with former champion Aurora Cunha of Portugal in third place. With Wang Huabi in seventh, the Chinese team achieved a championship record-low score of ten points. The Portuguese women achieved the lowest non-winning score in championship history, with 15 points, with Cunha being followed home by fourth placed Albertina Machado and Albertina Dias in eighth. Showing the dominance of the race by a handful of nations, a Yekaterina Khramenkova-led Soviet Union also achieved the lowest ever score for third place on 24 points.

<doc id="56559879" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56559879" title="Reads Landing Overlook">
Reads Landing Overlook

The Reads Landing Overlook is a scenic overlook on U.S. Route 61 in Pepin Township, Minnesota, United States. It was built from 1939 to 1940 as a New Deal project to provide motorists with a scenic view of Lake Pepin. It was designed by landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols and constructed by the National Youth Administration. The overlook was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004 for its state-level significance in the themes of landscape architecture and politics/government. It was nominated for exemplifying the early highway waysides built in Minnesota with federal work relief aid, and for exemplifying as well National Park Service rustic style and the work of Nichols.

The Reads Landing Overlook stands northwest of Reads Landing, Minnesota, and southeast of Lake City. It is situated on a stretch of Route 61 that runs due east/west along the south shore of Lake Pepin, a natural widening of the Mississippi River. Views from the overlook encompass the lake and its surrounding river valley, which is lined by wooded, bluffs on either shore. The bluffs of the south shore rise immediately adjacent to the roadbed of Route 61.

The overlook is built on a narrow strip of fill between the highway and a line of shoreside railroad tracks. The overlook's lakeside edge is defined by a retaining wall of random-coursed ashlars of Oneota Dolomite. The wall is thick with piers anchoring it at regular intervals. The midpoint of the symmetrical wall is bowed out to create a lookout bay that projects farther out toward the lake. At either end of the site, the retaining wall curves into bays with interpretive markers. The parking area has parallel parking space for four cars. A island with a stone curb once separated parking area from the highway. This and a five-car parking area on the opposite side of the road were largely eliminated when the highway was widened.

The interpretive marker at the east end of the overlook is an aluminum plaque with text regarding Lake Pepin. It is set into a freestanding wall of dolomite with decorative brickwork. Below the main plaque is a small bronze marker crediting construction to the National Youth Administration. The interpretive marker at the west end is unique. It takes the form of a bronze medallion with a geographical map of Minnesota. It is set on top of a square brick pedestal. The east and west markers are both flanked by walls with decorative herringbone brickwork and sport wide limestone steps at their feet.

The overlook plaza was originally paved with flagstones punctuated by five insets paved with asphalt. In 1994 the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) repaved the plaza with poured concrete to make it more handicap-accessible. Some of the flagstones were retained and placed in the configuration of the original asphalt insets, inverting the initial design but retaining the constrast of smooth and flagged surfaces. At the same time MnDOT added two concrete benches to the lookout bay, making up for the three limestone benches that had deteriorated and been removed over the intervening decades.

The lookout bay sports two interpretive signs added in the late 20th century. The first is a traditional black metal marker on a pole, placed in 1985 by MnDOT and the Minnesota Historical Society. The second is a modern interpretive sign printed on plastic, installed by MnDOT and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources in 1988 and slightly relocated during the 1994 renovations.

The Reads Landing Overlook is a distinctive example of Minnesota's first highway waysides, established in the 1930s and 40s as automobile tourism became popular. Overlooks were designed to provide a standard place for motorists to pull safely off the road for scenic views, rather than stopping randomly on road shoulders. The Reads Landing Overlook is uniquely adapted to a very narrow site and atypically combines elements of a scenic wayside with those of an interpretive wayside.

The adjacent highway was promoted as a scenic route from the first days of automobile touring in the 1910s. At that time the road system was not yet codified, and private groups took charge of marking and promoting routes. In 1921 the state highway system was formally organized, with this road along Minnesota's eastern border from Iowa to Canada becoming Highway 1. Four years later it was designated as part of U.S. Route 61. Long a gravel road, 61 was first paved through this vicinity in 1936. Owing to its importance and heavy use, the initial paving was done in concrete rather than cheaper but less durable asphalt. In 1938 an interstate commission formed to plan the Great River Road. Though Minnesota's portion would not be officialized until 1959, the portion along Lake Pepin was recognized as a scenic highlight from the beginning.

As use of the highway system expanded, the Minnesota Highway Department (later renamed the Minnesota Department of Transportation or MnDOT) opened the Roadside Development Division to concentrate on wayside facilities. The goal of these facilities was to improve highway aesthetics, increase safety, and aid the nascent automobile tourism industry by providing places for motorists to relax, eat, and use restrooms in the years before rest areas and convenience stores became commonplace. The waysides were generally designed in the National Park Service Rustic style, which emphasized the use of natural materials that would harmonize with the local environment and also endure with minimal maintenance.

Like most of Minnesota's early waysides, the Reads Landing Overlook was designed by landscape architect Arthur R. Nichols in consultation with MHD engineer Harold E. Olson. Nichols drew up his plans in August 1939 and they were approved with some revisions the following month. His design were adapted to the uniquely narrow site, squeezed at the base of a bluff between the highway and a sharp dropoff to railroad tracks and the lakeshore. As a consequence it resembles interpretive waysides like the Craigie Flour Mill Historical Marker rather than broad overlooks like the Garrison Concourse and Stillwater Overlook. Dolomite from the area was cut and laid with great attention to craftsmanship. Decorative accents were built with an orange/pink brick selected to contrast with the tan stone. The symmetrical plan and fine brick detailing exemplify the sophisticated formalism with which Nichols frequently imbued his rustic style designs.

Labor was provided through the National Youth Administration (NYA), a New Deal agency organized to provide employment and developmental opportunities for younger workers age 16 to 25. About 184,500 Minnesotans participated in the NYA from 1935 to 1943, building parks, playgrounds, highways, and public buildings. NYA labor produced at least 19 highway waysides for the Roadside Development Division in Minnesota, as well as picnic tables installed at many more sites.

The Reads Landing Overlook was one of five wayside rests built by the Roadside Development Division along Route 61 near Lake Pepin, four of which are still extant. Only three other areas of the state received similar concentrations of waysides in this era: the North Shore, Mille Lacs Lake, and around Stillwater.

Attempted net neutrality legislation in the United States

Arguments associated with net neutrality regulations in the US came into prominence in mid-2002, offered by the "High Tech Broadband Coalition", a group comprising the Business Software Alliance; the Consumer Electronics Association; the Information Technology Industry Council; the National Association of Manufacturers; the Semiconductor Industry Association; and the Telecommunications Industry Association, some of which were developers for Amazon.com, Google, and Microsoft. The full concept of "net neutrality" was developed by regulators and legal academics, most prominently law professors Tim Wu, Lawrence Lessig and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell often while speaking at the University of Colorado School of Law Annual Digital Broadband Migration conference or writing in the "Journal of Telecommunications and High Technology Law."

By late 2005, several Congressional draft bills contained net neutrality regulations, as a part of ongoing proposals to reform the Telecommunications Act of 1996, requiring Internet providers to allow consumers access to any application, content, or service. However, important exceptions have permitted providers to discriminate for security purposes, or to offer specialized services like "broadband video" service.

In April 2006, a large coalition of public interest, consumer rights and free speech advocacy groups and thousands of bloggers—such as Free Press, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, American Library Association, Christian Coalition of America, Consumers Union, Common Cause and MoveOn.org—launched the SavetheInternet.com Coalition, a broad-based initiative working to "ensure that Congress passes no telecommunications legislation without meaningful and enforceable network neutrality protections." Within two months of its establishment, it delivered over 1,000,000 signatures to Congress in favor of net neutrality policies and by the end of 2006, it had collected more than 1.5 million signatures.

Two proposed versions of "neutrality" legislation were to prohibit: (1) the "tiering" of broadband through sale of voice- or video-oriented "Quality of Service" packages; and (2) content- or service-sensitive blocking or censorship on the part of broadband carriers. These bills were sponsored by Representatives Markey, Sensenbrenner, et al., and Senators Snowe, Dorgan, and Wyden.

In 2006 Congressman Adam Schiff (D-California), one of the Democrats who voted for the 2006 Sensenbrenner-Conyers bill, said: "I think the bill is a blunt instrument, and yet I think it does send a message that it's important to attain jurisdiction for the Justice Department and for antitrust issues."

The following legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress to address the net neutrality question:

MRPS2

Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S2 (MRPS2), otherwise known as uS2m, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MRPS2 gene.

Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated 75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes, where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence homology. This gene encodes a 28S subunit protein that belongs to the ribosomal protein S2 family. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2012].

The UK Picture Editors' Guild is an association for British picture editors, based in Wickford, Essex, United Kingdom.

The guild was formed in 1977 by picture editors working for British national and regional newspapers and picture agencies, with the inaugural meeting on 5 December. Membership was initially restricted to picture editors and their deputies. Later, the membership was opened to other members of the picture desk and then widened to include picture researchers and others whose daily work is involved in editorial photography.

The guild has a membership of more than 100 and is run by a chair and a committee. It meets two or three times a year for social occasions, including a go karting event held at Buckmore Park.

The Guild also runs the Picture Editors' Awards. The awards are held in the Honourable Artillery Company headquarters, and attempt to show some of the most newsworthy and important photographs of the preceding year. The judging panel includes representatives from newspapers such as "The Daily Telegraph", "The Times" and "The Independent on Sunday". By 2016, the guild was receiving about 2,000 entries which were trimmed to a selection to just over 40.

The 2012 award was won by Jason Howe with his battlefield images photographed in Afghanistan. The 2014 nominations included a photograph of German figure skaters Nelli Zhiganshina and Alexander Gazsi at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Nominations for the 2017 award include a picture of the British Prime Minister Theresa May laughing (photographed by the "London Evening Standard" Jeremy Selwyn), Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn travelling to a campaign in Scotland, and a photograph of Grenfell Tower in flames.

He was born in Lisbon, the son of Aleixo de Sousa da Silva e Menezes, 2nd Count of Santiago de Beduído, and his wife D. Leonor Maria de Menezes, and brother of the 3rd and 4th Counts. He was a direct descendant of Vasco da Gama, Francisco de Portugal, 3rd Count of Vimioso, D. Afonso, Count of Ourém, and therefore also the first Duke of Braganza, D. Afonso. His studies took place at the University of Coimbra, where he graduated with a degree in Canon law. Further receiving the insignia of clerical character on 13 April 1721, the Minor Orders on 17 September 1734 and the diaconia on 20 December 1738.

Ordained priest on 1 May 1739, he was appointed "Primarius principalis" of the Patriarchate of Lisbon on 31 July 1755. Thereafter appointed chaplain-vicar of Lisbon on 1 November 1776. He situated his residence in the Palace of Junqueira, in Lisbon.

He was created cardinal in the consistory of 1 June 1778, the Pope sending the cardinal's cap with Mons. Francesco Serlupi, as he never ventured to Rome to receive his cap and respective title. He was named Patriarch of Lisbon by Queen Maria on 14 August 1778., and on 1 March 1779, he received his pallium. In a pastoral letter on 2 April, he confessed his reluctance to accept the appointment and the uneasiness that plagued him in his perception that it would be useless to refuse.

His appointment was consecrated on 30 May 1779, in the chapel of the Palace of Junqueira. His solemn entry into the city was made the following June. He died on 11 April 1786, at 7 o'clock, of apoplexy in Lisbon and was buried alongside his predecessor, Cardinal Francisco de Saldanha da Gama, in the Jerónimos Monastery in Lisbon.

The Ceylon Trade Union Federation (abbreviated CTUF) was a national trade union centre in Ceylon/Sri Lanka. CTUF was founded in December 1940, united various unions led by the United Socialist Party. The founding meeting of CTUF was chaired by a Buddhist monk, Ven. Saranankara. Pieter Keuneman served as CTUF president for some time.

Soon after its foundation, CTUF ordered its affiliates to reorganise from company unions to unions by industrial sector.

CTUF led a major strike amongst harbour workers in July 1941. Nevertheless, during the remainder of the Second World War, the party adopted a line of avoiding confrontations as a way to support the 'anti-fascist' war effort. As of 1944 CTUF represented eleven unions with a combined membership of 18,000. After the formation of the Communist Party in 1943, CTUF remained closely tied to the new party. CTUF joined the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1945. On September 15, 1945 CTUF organized a mass rally to the State Council to demand solution to unemployment problem. As the government refused to hear the demands of the protestors, CTUF organized a token half-day strike, mobilizing some 8,000 workers, followed by a six-day strike of some 30,000 workers. The strike was settled after the Mayor of Colombo intervened.

In April 1958 a strike action of CTUF, the Ceylon Mercantile Union and the Ceylon Federation of Labour resulted in violence between striking workers and police.

In 1962 CTUF reached its peak strength, organizing almost 80,000 members. As of 1963 CTUF organized 31 unions with 68,130 members. In the internal split in the Communist Party in 1963, CTUF was seized by the Peking Wing faction. At the time of the split N. Shanmugathasan was the general secretary of CTUF, and A.D. Charleshamy and H. Jayawardena its vice presidents. Following the split in the Communist Party, Watson Fernando became president of CTUF whilst N. Shanmugathasan remained as general secretary. In response to the Communist Party (Peking Wing) taking control of CTUF, the Communist Party (Moscow Wing) set up the Ceylon Federation of Trade Unions (CFTU).

After the 1971 JVP insurrection, the Communist Party (Peking Wing) was targetted by government repression. Many leaders of the party were arrested. CTUF was temporarily disbanded. By 1974 CTUF had become practically defunct. Most CTUF leaders joined CFTU instead, some joined other groups.

Google Hire

Google Hire is an applicant tracking system developed by Google that helps small to medium businesses (SMBs) to distribute jobs, identify and attract candidates, build strong relationships with candidates, and efficiently manage the interview process – using familiar Google solutions such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Hangouts. Launched on July 18, 2017, Google Hire is currently available to companies in the United States who use G Suite. 

Since the launch, Hire has received positive reviews from HR professionals: “on Day One, Google Hire is already light years ahead of most of its competition in terms of helping drive hiring efficiency and productivity within the SMB market”; “It’s way better than the typical small business ATS”. Somewhat hyperbolically, it has also been called “a watershed moment in the annals of HR Technology history”, “one of the most exciting products to come around the HR Technology space in a very long time”, and “looks and feels a whole lot like the ATS of the future”.

Analysts and customers alike give Google Hire credit for the native integrations with the tools where people spend their day: Google Gmail and Google Calendar. “Its pitch is simple: for recruiters who already spend much of their day in Gmail and Google Calendar, they can schedule interviews in Hire much faster and with a lot fewer clicks.” The result of these G Suite integrations is that Hire customer can recruit faster. 

Customers also praise Hire for its ease of use, affordability and efficiency: “It’s easy to use, easily accessible”, “user-friendly, affordable, and efficient”.
Google Hire allow customers to create unique hiring stages for each department or even each job opening because the hiring process for an engineer and a sales are different. Companies can post their job openings to the major job boards like Indeed, Glassdoor, and Google for Jobs, track the efficacy of each source. Once a candidate profile is created in Google Hire, recruiters and hiring managers can get more insight about the candidate with automatic Google search that discovers the candidate’s profiles on many web sites such as LinkedIn, GitHub, and so on. The candidate pipeline for each job opening can be easily viewed, filtered and sorted by the candidate source, stage, current company and other attributes. Recruiters and hiring managers can quickly review new candidate resumes, and advance or reject individual candidates with one click, or bulk advance or reject multiple candidates. Google Hire makes it easy to organize and tack candidates candidates in collections that can be shared with anyone in the organization. The app allows recruiters to search the database of past candidates in order to discover profiles that may be a good fit for new job openings. Any member of a hiring team can collaborate with colleagues on a candidate profile through an easy @mention feature. Interview scheduling is integrated with Google Calendar, and once an interview is over, the interviewers can enter interview feedback without even having to log into the system. An interviewer cannot see feedback from fellow interviewers they enter their own - in order to prevent bias and provide an additional incentive to leave feedback. Google Hire has a Gmail add-on that brings key recruiting functionality right into the user’s email inbox. And any email communication with a candidate is also tracked on the candidate profile in Google Hire. The email communications are streamlined and made consistent with email templates. Each recruiter, hiring manager and interviewer can stay on top of important and urgent tasks with a comprehensive dashboard that highlights upcoming interviews, pending feedback requests, comments on candidates, or emails from candidates.

Jane Bragg Pitman

Jane Bragg Pitman (1825 - February 11, 1877) was an English-born writer and reporter known for her shorthand in the United States. She was also active in the arts and crafts movement in the United States for her wood engravings. 

Jane Bragg was born in Birmingham, England in 1825. She was the only daughter of a family with three brothers, John and William Bragg. She received an education at a private school in England and soon became a tutor for the institution. In 1844, Bragg was accredited with writing the children's book "Birds and insects: Dialogues in prose and verse, illustrative of their habits and instinct". In 1844, she took a phonography class lead by Benjamin (Benn) and Isaac Pitman. In 1849, she married Benjamin Pitman. In June 1850, Jane and Benjamin Pitman had their first daughter, Agnes Pitman. The couple had their first son, Arnold, in 1851 and their second son, Ellis, in 1853. 

While pregnant with her third child, Elis, the Pitman family moved to the United States in January 1853. They moved to the United States due to the influence of Benjamin Pitman's brother, Isaac, who wanted to establish and spread phonographic shorthand before it was popularized. Soon after the move, while transitioning in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Jane gave birth to her second son, Ellis. Both Ellis and Arnold died during their brief stay in Pennsylvania. By 1855, the Pitman's settled in Cincinnati, Ohio where her husband established the Cincinnati Phonographic Institute. 

In Cincinnati, Bragg learned the publication of phonographic and phonetic works, engraving and type setting, and typography. She revised the final proofs of D.S Smalley's "American Phonetic Dictionary of English Language" published in 1855. Bragg was also noted to work with her husband in assisting his court case reports and dictating matter from testimonies. She improved court dictation by using a team of writers to dictate one sentence at a time and combine it together later. Bragg was the official reporter for the New Orleans riot of 1866. 

Bragg fell ill 1877, and was an invalid for the last year of her life. She died on February 11th, 1878 in their residence in Hillside, Ohio at 52 years old.

Like her daughter, Agnes Pitman, and husband, Benn Pitman, Jane Bragg began wood carving. In 1872, Jane and her daughter, Agnes, carved several pieces of furniture, doors, and other architectural woodwork which was submitted to the Third Annual Cincinnati Industrial Exhibition. In 1876, Pitman carved a chest of drawers embellished with carved floral motifs representing the months of April through September which was shown in the Cincinnati Room of the Women's Pavilion at the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition. 

Throughout Bragg's artistic creations, such as her children's book "Birds and insects: Dialogues in prose and verse, illustrative of their habits and instinct". In her wood carvings, wildlife is a common motif. Birds were carved into her book along with the mantle over the fireplace in her home. Bragg was known to love gardening and had botanical knowledge of the plants and flowers she cared for.

Alli Raani

Alli Raani (), also known as Alli Arasani, is a legendary Tamil queen of the Sangam period, who is thought to have ruled the whole western and northern coast of Sri Lanka from her capital Kudiramalai. According to folklore, her fort, Allirani fort, is located in Mannar, Sri Lanka. She is sometimes seen as an incarnation or multiform of Meenakshi and Kannagi. Legends attribute her as an "Amazon" ruler, who had an administrative and an army of only women, with male being their subordinates and servants. 

She is referred in several texts such as "Alli katai", "Alli Arasani Maalai", "Pavazhakodi Maalai" and "Pulavendran Kalava Maalai." She is also depicted in a popular dramatic compilation in Tamil language, entitled as "Alli Arasani Nadakam".

The only daughter of a Pandyan king, she was considered an immaculate conception as she was found on an "alli" (Tamil word for lily) after the end of a Putrakameshti ritual. She was at young age sent to gurukula and perfected riding and martial arts. Alli Raani is described as beautiful, courages and alert. She defeated and killed in a battle an usurper to the Pandyan throne named "Neenmugan", "The blue faced one", who came at her with an army. Upon defeating was she crowned the to throne of Madurai.

Several myths attribute her as married to the Mahabharata hero Arjuna. Arjuna who penetrated the palace of Alli Raani, took the form of an old ascetic man. He called out for the love of the queen, who responded back by sending snakes and elephants to kill him. Arjuna later on came to her room in the form of a snake as she was asleep, thereupon embracing the queen. According to other versions of this myth is this event followed by a marriage with Arjuna tying the Thaali on Alli Raani.

Alli Raani ruled over the in western and northern coasts of Sri Lanka and controlled there the pearl fishery. According to local traditions did the gulf of Arasadi have no opening towards the north, but communicated with the sea by a channel running in the line of the present Chilaw canal. Alli Raani used to proceed from Kudiramalai to Akkaraipattu by land. A great flood submerged greater parts of land, subsequently leaving Arasadi on a narrow split of land, forming the present Puttalam Lagoon and destroying her palace.

Disneyland social club

A Disneyland social club is an organized group of Disneyland fans who express their fandom by wearing matching jackets or vests bearing back patch designs that are reminiscent of motorcycle gangs. Although they borrow certain aesthetic traits of motorcycle gang subculture, Disneyland social clubs are not gangs and have been dubbed by OC Weekly as "The Very Merry Un-Gangs of Disneyland." By most accounts, these social clubs are harmless groups of friends, family, and children gathering at the theme parks to have fun, enjoy each other's company, and to share a geeky enthusiasm for all things Disney. Every club has their own membership requirements and guidelines, but most seem to adhere to following all Disney Parks rules, cooperating with cast members, being courteous and friendly, and being respectful of the park itself.

The current wave of Disneyland social clubs is not the first time that youth groups and social clubs have been present at Disneyland. On August 6, 1970, hundreds of Yippies conquered Tom Sawyer Island, climbed the Main Street flag pole, blocked major thoroughfares, got into fights with park guests, security and police, and forced an early, unexpected closure. The late 1990s saw an influx of local Southern California teenagers following the introduction of more youth-centric attractions and the low cost of an annual pass.

The first of this current wave of Disneyland social club was The Black Death Crew, which began on March 29, 2012 as a group of friends wearing all black clothing to Disneyland in Anaheim, California. However The Neverlanders Social Club, founded in October 2012, are believed to be the first patched social club to wear jackets/vests bearing back patches. They were followed by The Hitchhikers Social Club which was founded in February 2013 and The Main Street Elite Social Club, which was founded in early 2013.

The first known reference to Disneyland social clubs appeared on an April 17, 2013 Internet forum post on MiceChat.com.

The presence of those first patched club members wandering the parks created a style that other groups quickly copied. Subsequently, the number of patched Disneyland social clubs grew and by March 2014 there were over 20 social clubs in existence. Coincidentally, in July 2013 the Disney Channel premiered a Disney Channel Original Movie entitled "Teen Beach Movie" which features a group of motorcycle bikers calling themselves "The Rodents Social Club" who wear matching motorcycle jackets emblazoned with their club name and a picture of a mouse.

Each Disneyland social club bears a unique name, usually in an homage to some form of Disney franchise (e.g. theme park attractions, movies, TV shows, etc.) and each club has its own leather jacket, jean jacket, varsity letterman jacket, or vest which bears custom-made patches of their mascot logo and club name on the back. The jacket/vest fronts may feature the member’s name and their favorite character or attraction, as well as Disney trading pins.

As of 2017, over 100 patched social clubs have been founded by Disney Parks fans.

In a lawsuit filed on Sept. 11, 2017 in Orange County Superior Court, John Sarno, the founder of the Main Street Fire Station 55 Social Club, claims he was bullied and terrorized by members of the White Rabbits Social Club. Sarno accuses members of the White Rabbits of cyberbullying, defamation through false statements, invasion of medical privacy, infliction of emotional distress, and causing Leslee Sarno to lose her job. John and Leslee Sarno organized a September 11 attacks benefit memorial walk in 2016. A week before the event, John Sarno claims Jakob Fite and four other members of the White Rabbits Social Club approached him, demanding $500 protection money. Sarno refused to pay, claims that Fite and others have since cyberbullied him with malicious rumors on podcasts and social media sites that are frequented by other Disneyland social clubs. Sarno also alleges that Fite attempted to make he and his wife appear to be drug addicts by hacking into the their confidential medical files and publishing the medications that were prescribed to them by their physicians, a violation of federal HIPAA privacy laws. Sarno also sued Kaiser Foundation Health Plan claiming that Kaiser failed to protect his medical information, and sued Disneyland saying the park took “no steps to stop the White Rabbits’ malicious conduct.” As a result of this controversy, John Sarno, has disbanded his social club and shut down its website, and Disneyland has declined to permit further memorial walks.

1991 IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships

The 1991 IAAF World Women's Road Race Championships was the ninth and final edition of the annual international road running competition organised by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF). The competition was hosted by the Netherlands on 13 October 1991 in Nieuwegein and featured one race only: a 15K run for women. There were individual and team awards available, with the national team rankings being decided by the combined finishing positions of a team's top three runners. Countries with fewer than three finishers were not ranked.

Romania's Iulia Olteanu defended her title from the 1990 race with a winning time of 48:42 minutes. In the tightest ever finish seen in the competition's history, four women finished within the space of three seconds. Andrea Wallace of Great Britain took the runner-up spot while Germany's Uta Pippig edged out Soviet athlete Nadezhda Ilyina for third place by a fraction of a second. Pippig led Germany to its first ever team title at the competition with the former East German being backed up by former West German teammates Kerstin Pressler and Iris Biba. The Romanian women, headed by Olteanu, were two points adrift in second, with Georgeta State in seventh and Nuța Olaru in 16th place. In third, the Soviet Union took a sixth consecutive team medal (having reached the podium on every occasion it entered a team) through the performances of Ilyina, Marina Rodchenkova and Yelena Zhupiyeva.

The ending of this championships series coincided with the IAAF launching the 1992 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships a year later, thus a women's road world championship remained in the form of the half marathon distance.

Aeroflot Flight 13

Aeroflot Flight 13 ( "Reys 13 Aeroflota") was a scheduled Soviet domestic passenger flight from Baku, Azerbaijan to Fort-Shevchenko in Kazakhstan that crashed on 18 August 1973 shortly after takeoff, killing 56 of the 64 passengers and crew aboard. The Antonov An-24 had suffered an engine failure on takeoff and was attempting to return to the airport when it struck an oil rig cable at low altitude resulting in a crash. At the time, it was the second worst accident involving the An-24 and remains the second worst aviation accident in Azerbaijani history. 

The aircraft involved in the accident was an Antonov An-24B registered CCCP-46435 to Aeroflot. The Antonov An-24 is a twin engine medium haul transport/passenger aircraft that was introduced in 1962. The 'B' variant of the model increased passenger capacity and modified the flaps to increase performance. CCCP-46435 entered service in 1968 and was operating under the Azerbaijan Civil Aviation Administration. At the time of the accident, the aircraft had sustained 7,374 flight hours and 5,502 pressurization cycles.

Four crew members were aboard the flight. The crew consisted of:

At 18:36 MSK on 18 August 1973, CCCP-46435 took off from Baku-Bina International Airport for an approximately 300 mile (480 km) flight to the Kazakh town of Fort-Shevchenko. Weather at the time was fair with ten kilometers of visibility, and wind coming from the north. On board were sixty passengers, including eleven children, and four crew who were on their second flight of the day. Just 30 feet (10 m) above the runway, the An-24 suffered an uncontained failure of the left engine. At 90 feet (30 m) the crew retracted the flaps and began turning left at an altitude of 120 feet (40 m). As it turned, the left wingtip struck the cable of an oil rig in the Caspian Sea, shearing it off. The plane descended, striking a pipeline, before crashing near a highway at 18:51 MSK. 54 people on board were killed and eight others seriously injured including the flight's captain and flight engineer.

An investigation of the crash blamed the engine failure on the degradation of the turbine blades in the engine as a result of continuous overheating. This overheating can stem from several causes including not following the correct start-up procedures, design flaws, and the inability to detect overheating by visual means or through instrument indications. The plane was also overloaded beyond its weight capacity by 193 kilograms (425 lbs).

Anne Wright (author)

Anne Wright (1793 – 18 January 1861) was a British author, most notably of children's books about natural sciences. Her most well-known work was originally published as a series of letters and later compiled into one volume, titled "The Observing Eye, or Letters to Children on the Three Lowest Divisions of Animal Life" (1851).

Anne Wright was born in 1793 in Calverton, Buckinghamshire. In 1816 she married John Wright, whose uncle is known for launching the first sea-going steamboat. Most of her writing was complete from a farm in Buxton, Derbyshire, where she was a very active participant in the community. Wright had two children, Jonathon and Fredrick. She died on the 18th of January 1861, in Blakeney, Norfolk.

Anne Wright's most well-known work during her time was "The Observing Eye". It received great critical acclaim, a geologist, Hugh Miller, saying "[The Observing Eye] is quite a model of the way in which the study of living nature ought to be brought before the minds of children." In fact, this work was chosen by Queen Victoria to be in the collection that was to be read by the royal children. Wright herself took an interest in geology, sometimes gathering and studying different specimens. Several of her works involved the geology and other natural sciences:

Wright was an active participant in her neighborhood. She was a figure often present at the local school, and "Mrs. Wright's Stories" drew a lot of interest from the children. In 1853, Wright's husband John established a reformatory in their own neighborhood; Anne Wright was very enthusiastic about helping reform the inmates through instruction.

United States Mounted Rangers

United States Mounted Rangers was a battalion of mounted rangers raised in 1832. It was operating at the frontier, but proved itself to be lacking in discipline, and being very costly. It was disbanded and replaced with a regular dragoon regiment in 1833.

At the time of the formation of the United States Mountain Rangers, the United States Army lacked cavalry. The opening of the Santa Fe Trail led to demands for military escorts of the annual trading caravans across the prairies. In 1829 four infantry companies from Fort Leavenworth were ordered to protect that year's caravan. This expedition demonstrated the inferiority of foot soldiers versus mounted Comanches. At the end of 1831, Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri put forward a bill authorizing President Jackson to organize a mounted ranger unit of volunteers for frontier defense. The outbreak of the Black Hawk War meant that the bill was promptly passed by both houses of the Congress. The decision to organize a volunteer battalion instead of a regular cavalry regiment, emanated from the prevalent attitudes of the ruling Democratic Party toward the United States Army. The Regular Army was being seen as a stronghold of aristocratic West Pointers in contrast with the virtuous citizen soldiers of the militia.

The Mounted Rangers was organized with six companies, each with a captain, a first lieutenant, a second lieutenant, a third lieutenant, five sergeans, five corporals, and 100 private rangers. Henry Dodge became major and commander; captains were Lemuel Ford, Benjamin V. Becks, Jesse B. Brown, Jesse Bean, Nathan Boone, and Matthew Duncan. The officers and NCOs were appointed directly from civilian life. The private rangers were hardened hunters, trappers, and other outdoorsmen, used to a rugged life. They enlisted for one year only, and had to supply their own mounts, horse tack, weapons, equipment, and clothing, and pay for their horses' forage. As compensation they received one dollar a day in addition to the pay.

Three companies of the Mounted Rangers were stationed at Fort Armstrong, Illinois, in the aftermath of the Black Hawk War. The three other companies were stationed at Fort Gibson, Indian Territory. Their mission was to support the Indian agents and negotiators under Henry Ellsworth that tried to mediate between the native population and the members of the Five Civilized Tribes that had been removed beyond the Mississippi. One of the Fort Gibson companies were later moved to Fort Leavenworth, to fulfill the mounted rangers' intended mission of escorting caravans on the Santa Fe Trail.

The Mounted Rangers were disbanded when the one-year enlistment period ended. The rangers had revealed themselves as lacking in discipline, and their leather hunting shirts had become so soiled that citizens and Indians could not separate them from common militia. When the Secretary of War, Lewis Cass, demonstrated that the battalion was more costly than a regular regiment of dragoons, the fate of the Mounted Ranges was sealed. The congress decided to replace them with a regiment of United States Dragoons; the commanding officer of the Mounted Rangers, Major Henry Dodge, becoming colonel and its first commander. Four captains and four lieutenants of the Mounted Rangers also becoming officers of the Dragoons.

He is Chair of the Department of Obstetrics Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine and Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale-New Haven Hospital. His clinical interests include In vitro fertilisation, infertility, endometriosis, implantation, menopause, uterine anomalies and DES exposure.

Hugh Taylor received his undergraduate degree in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry from Yale University in 1983 and his medical degree from University of Connecticut in 1983. He completed his residency in Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale-New Haven Hospital and fellowships in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, and Molecular Bio, at Yale University School of Medicine.

In addition to his clinical practice, Taylor holds multiple positions at Yale. He is the Anita O'Keeffe Young Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine and a Professor of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at Yale University. Taylor served as Chief of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility before being named Chair of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine and Chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Yale–New Haven Hospital in 2012.

Outside of the Yale School of Medicine, Taylor holds other leadership roles. Taylor "is the editor-in-chief of the journal "Reproductive Sciences" and editor of "Endocrinology". He serves on the board of directors of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), where he is president-elect of the endometriosis interest group and on the governing council of the Society for Gynecologic Investigation (SGI)." Taylor is also Clinical Director of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, the organization that sets standards for in vitro fertilization practice in the United States and a clinical adviser to the Endometriosis Association.

Taylor's research has been continuously funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for more than 20 years. He has received eight NIH grants for his research and has published over 125 articles in prominent medical journals.Taylor's clinical research focuses on endometriosis, implantation, and menopause.

Taylor's research group has identified mechanisms and molecules that lead to and regulate endometriosis, including stem cells, epigenetics and microRNAs.
In 2016 and 2017, Taylor contributed to studies that found significant levels of multiple microRNA biomarkers in patients with surgically confirmed endometriosis. Additionally, his laboratory was the first to identify an outside source of stem cells that contribute to endometrial regeneration.

Taylor presented his group's papers on serum microRNAs for diagnosing endometriosis and increased anxiety, depression, and pain perception with endometriosis in mice at the 2017 American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference. His research was awarded with the Endometriosis Special Interest Group (EndoSIG) clinical/population science prize paperand EndoSIG basic science prize paper.

In the late 1990s, Taylor and his colleagues published a series of studies showing the function of a homeotic gene called HOXA10, which is expressed during implantation in the endometrium. They found that this gene is altered in the endometrium of women with endometriosis and in infertility cases associated with failed implantation.

Clinical and translational studies performed by Taylor's research team look at the effects of endometrial menopausal hormone therapies. These studies show that hormone therapies for menopause may lead to increased risk of breast cancer in some patients and emphasize the benefit of using individualized care methods when treating menopause.

People's Open Network

People's Open Network is a community wireless mesh network being built by a local volunteer group, Sudo Mesh, based in Oakland, California. It is a project of the Sudo Room hackerspace. As of 2017, there were more than 50 network nodes functioning across Oakland. Founders of the People's Open Network want to give more people access to better and cheaper communication tools while creating platforms for locally relevant and decentralized web applications.

Community members can join the network by purchasing an internet router and installing open-source firmware on the device. Once plugged in, the router can connect to the active mesh network and double as a hotspot that automatically connects with others in range. The group even runs educational workshops to spread awareness and help the public learn to create their own mesh networking solutions.

Matt Senate, one of the founders of Sudo Room, told Tech President in 2014 that Sudo Mesh is “building and growing a network run by and for the community." Senate explained that Occupy Oakland offered a new style of governance and that the People’s Open Network was building that community ethos into the telecommunications infrastructure. 

Jenny Ryan, a cyberanthropologist, free culture advocate, and one of the original members of the Sudo Mesh team, noted the East Bay has long nourished a particularly radical streak, largely at odds with authority. She told Tech President that Oakland “building a community-owned telecommunications infrastructure is one piece to the larger picture of building autonomy and people power.”

Nelcia Robinson-Hazell

Nelcia Robinson-Hazell (also known as Nelcia Marshall-Robinson and Nelcia Robinson) is a Black Carib poet, community organizer and activist. She has spearheaded the development of policy initiatives throughout the Caribbean on issues regarding gender and indigenous identity. Serving as the president of the National Council of Women of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, she began in the 1980s to change the organization toward political action. Recognizing a need to establish research on the needs of women, she was involved in the creation of both local and regional organizations to analyze and develop information about the socio-economic and political inequalities women faced. She created similar initiatives for indigenous peoples, beginning first in Saint Vincent and then expanding them regionally. Robinson has been involved in international directives including the World Summit for Social Development and the 1995 World Conference on Women, as well as follow-up conferences discussing such issues as poverty, economic empowerment and violence against women. She has served as a civil society representative on the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commissions and as chair of the Commonwealth Women's Network.

Nelcia Marshall was born in Greggs Village in the central part of the Windward Islands on Saint Vincent in the British West Indies. Her heritage is Black Carib, as her ancestors were given amnesty to remain in St. Vincent when the Garifuna were expelled from the island. The ethnic group, which is a mixed heritage of West African, Arawak, and Island Carib, is considered the genetic parent of the Garifuna people, but differ in that Black Caribs have higher concentrations of indigenous genes, whereas Garifuna have higher African markers. Marshall grew up in Questelles, where she attended Questelles Primary School. After completing her secondary education, she earned a Bachelor of Science in Human Services at Springfield College, in Springfield, Massachusetts. She went on to study international development as a Kellogg Fellow.

In 1983, Marshall-Robinson was elected president of the National Council of Women. Under her leadership, the organization shifted from a traditional women's organization dealing with social issues toward an activist agency seeking political change. Because the National Council of Women was a government umbrella entity, political changes were reflected by inconsistent approach to women's concerns. To counter-balance the whims of different administrations, Robinson and others established the Committee for the Development of Women in 1984 to conduct research on women's issues. She served as the Committee's coordinator. Robinson ran as a candidate for the United Progressive Movement (UPM) party in the island's elections for the House of Assembly in 1984. In 1985, she became a founding member of the Caribbean Association for Feminist Research and Action (CAFRA), an organization aimed at analyzing and documenting the socio-economic and political inequalities facing women in the region, as a means upon which to base corrective political actions. 

In 1987, Robinson became coordinator of the Caribbean Association of Indigenous People. Two years previously, in response to the sale of land in the traditional Carib homelands to a Danish development company, she had worked to organize indigenous Carib community members to enable them to leverage their collective bargaining abilities with the government. The community formed the Campaign for the Development of the Carib Community and their pressure on the government, led to the nationalization of the property. Through continued outreach, Robinson has worked to reestablish ties between the Black Carib community of Saint Vincent and the Garifuna populations in Belize and other Central American countries, through cultural heritage programs. She has published five collections of poetry and a poetry award in St. Vincent bears her name.

In 1995, Robinson attended the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen, participating in a hunger strike by women from developing nations to bring attention to the need for assistance to eliminate poverty and for debt relief from developed nations. Her concerns were that small island nations in the Caribbean due to size and environmental factors were vulnerable under existing trade policies and that the vulnerability adversely impacted women to a greater extent, because women were often "viewed as a source of cheap exploitable labour". She subsequently assisted in the planning events for the 1995 World Conference on Women held in Beijing and the follow-up conferences held in 2005 and 2010.

Robinson served as the coordinator of CAFRA from 1996 to 2009. In 2003, she was appointed to serve as a civil society representative on the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commissions (RJLSC), which with the establishment of the Caribbean Court of Justice was created to propose and recommend judicial candidates to ensure that the judiciary remains independent of political influence. In 2009, Robinson-Hazell became a Goodwill Ambassador, and was granted a diplomatic passport, by the cabinet of Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves.

Hazell has been involved in numerous endeavors to improve vulnerable populations including serving on the executive of the National Youth Council, as the coordinator for Serving Housebound and Retired Elderly (SHARE), president of the Association of Social Workers and on a regional level has served as the national representative for the Caribbean Network for Integrated Rural Development (CNIRD) and as the Caribbean Gender and Trade Network's coordinator since 1999. In 2012, she passed the presidency of the National Council of Women of SVG to Anesta Rodney. In 2013, she was the chair of the Commonwealth Women's Network, an organization which works to secure economic empowerment and gender equality, as well as alleviate violence against women.

<doc id="56560662" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56560662" title="The Passing of Shah Jahan (Tagore)">
The Passing of Shah Jahan (Tagore)

The Passing of Shah Jahan is a Miniature painting, painted by the Indian artist Abanindranath Tagore in 1902. The painting depicts a scene in which the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan stares upon the Taj Mahal in his deathbed, with his daughter at his feet. Initially involved with the dominant style of European Naturalism, Tagore's mentor E.B Havell had introduced him to various types of Indian art. Of these varieties, Tagore was most impressed with old Mughal miniatures, which often featured emotionless, but detailed illustrations of scenes and characters. Incorporating this style with the traditional Indian artistic concept of "Bhava"', or emotion, Tagore had painted a scene based upon the growing re-interest in Indian history during the British Raj.

The painting had helped to establish Tagore as one of the most well known Indian artists of his time. In addition to creating a whole new movement of Indian style painting, Tagore later on went to paint more artwork depicting nationalist and swadeshi themes during the time of the Independence movement.

Abanindranath Tagore was born in August 7 1871 to Gunendranath Tagore. A nephew of the Indian poet and artist Rabindranath Tagore, Abanindranath was exposed at an early age to the artistic inclinations of the Tagore family. 

Tagore had been exposed to learning art when he first studied at the Sanskrit College in Kolkata in the 1880's. In his early years, Tagore had painted in the European naturalistic style, evident from his early paintings such as "The Armoury". In about 1886 or 1887, Tagore's relative Gyanadanandini Devi had set up a meeting between Tagore and E.B Havell, who was the curator of the Government school of Art in Calcutta. The meeting resulted in a series of exchanges between Havell and Tagore, with Havell gaining a native art collaborator with ideas in the same direction of his own, and Tagore gaining a teacher who would teach him about the 'science' of Indian art history.

Havell attempted to induct Tagore as the Vice Principal of the art school, which was faced with heavy opposition in the school. Havell had to bend much of the school rules to do this, and tolerated many of Tagore's habits including the smoking of hookah in the classrooms and refusing to stick to time schedules. Havell introduced innovations to his teaching program in an attempt to more accurately reproduce Indian art pedagogy, and replaced European copies of art with Indian originals. The English art curator had also reportedly spent many hours behind closed doors explaining the details of "Hindu art and sculpture" to Tagore. One of these paintings, of a stork by a Mughal-era artist, had been shown to Tagore by Havell, causing the former to remark that he was unaware until then of the "embarassment[sic?] of riches" that "our art" had contained.

"The Passing of Shah Jahan" depicts a scene with the fifth Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who had commissioned in his lifetime the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his favorite wife Mumatz Mahal. The architectural facade which frames the painting clearly represents a painstaking replication of marble inlay work decoration and complex railing patterns. The painting's attention is concentrated upon two main figures: the dying Shah Jahan and his daughter at the end of his bed, while the Mughal emperor's gaze is drawn to a small depiction of the Taj Mahal in the upper corner.

Earlier renderings of the subject in literature had focused on Mughal wars of succession, and depicted Shah Jahan as an aging king who's illness and weakness had been the cause of instability and war. Locked in his room in the Red Fort by his son Aurangzeb, Shah Jahan was seen as a 'poor palace builder' whose only achievement was his monument to love: the Taj Mahal. Many British colonial authorities had went further and sought to differentiate between the current regime and that of the Mughals, in order to demonstrate the lasting vitality of the British colonial Empire. Tagore's painting fits this description due to the widely available Colonial literature and attitude of the day.

E.B Havell's interest in monuments and sculpture never found a place with Tagore. What had attracted him the most was the intimacy of relationship found in Indian art which was further exemplified by the selective realism in Mughal miniatures. Realism not in terms of surfaces, but rather of expressions. The three major types of painting that were to have inspired Tagore were British watercolor painting, Mughal miniatures, and Japanese painting. The incorporation of these styles is evident in "The Passing of Shah Jahan". Tagore moved from a normative realism used as a tool for objective expression, into a freer naturalism that would draw attention to specific areas through realism.

Tagore's works typically have no anonymity in form, and themes of individualism are almost always present; this has met with some criticism amongst art critiques. In addition, Tagore sought to incorporate "Bhava", or feeling, into his artwork. This idea of 'feeling' was especially important to the 'Passing of Shah Jahan'; the painting had attempted to explain the romantic ideas of loss, focusing on Shah Jahan's imprisonment at the Red Fort and the loss of his wife. Prior to Tagore, this idea was never visualized, though many Mughal and Western artists had drew many portraits and figures of Shah Jahan and other Mughal characters. However, neither group had attempted to illustrate the emotions of these characters nor did they contain narrative elements. Tagore's attempt to depict the pathos of Shah Jahan imprisoned in the Red Fort and his last look at the Taj Mahal was a revolutionary element in Indian painting, especially at a time when the study of Indian history gained attention by British colonialists and native Indian people.

The "Passing of Shah Jahan" won several awards. It was first exhibited at the Delhi Durbar Exhibition of Arts and Crafts (1902-1903), where it had won a silver medal. The painting was next exhibited at the Congress Industrial Exhibition (1903) where it had won a Gold medal. After Tagore had received public recognition for his works, many other artists had begun to incorporate the same themes and techniques.

Abanindranath Tagore was eventually known to be one of the most well known Indian artists of his time,both in and outside of Bengal, due to the nationalist works during the swadeshi years. Tagore went on to become a founder of the new school of Indian-style painting, though this became a role he had increasingly distanced himself from during his later years.

Suburban Voodoo

Suburban Voodoo is the second solo studio album by English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack. In between his previous solo album (1980's "Nightbird") and this release, Carrack had been a member of Squeeze, singing lead on their 1981 hit "Tempted". 

The band on this album, dubbed Noise To Go, was the result of arrangement between Nick Lowe and Carrack to provide backing on each other's albums. The same group of musicians, but with Lowe as lead vocalist, is heard on Lowe's albums "Nick the Knife" (1982) and "The Abominable Showman" (1983). 

The album includes Carrack's first chart hit as a solo artist, "I Need You", which entered the US top 40 in mid-1982, peaking at #36. 

Thirty years after the release of this LP, Carrack re-recorded the "Suburban Voodoo" album track "From Now On" (in a very different arrangement) for his 2012 album "Good Feeling". 

AllMusic's William Ruhlmann notes that "Suburban Voodoo" "sounds very much like a (Nick) Lowe album with Carrack singing. That's all to the good, though, since Carrack's supple voice is well-suited to Lowe's updated '60s rock & roll style." Ruhlmann goes on to call "Suburban Voodoo" "an unusually tuneful album." 

Jim Green of "Trouser Press" also noted the Nick Lowe connection, writing that ""Suburban Voodoo" sounds like the souled-up flipside of "Nick the Knife" — if anything, it's better. Yet it succeeds because of Lowe's production and composing presence, which complements Carrack's excellent voice with the kind of pop smarts that bring out his best."

Credits are adapted from the album's liner notes.

Frontenac Lake is a freshwater body of the Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec unorganized territory in the northwestern part of the Regional County Municipality (RCM) Le Domaine-du-Roy in the region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. This lake extends entirely in the canton of Buade.

Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second.

The forest road R0212 (East-West direction) cuts the middle of the course of the Milieu River (Normandin River). While the forest road R0223 serves the Valley of the Marquette River West, on the west side of Poutrincourt Lake. This last road connects to the Northeast at route 167 linking Chibougamau and Saint-Félicien, Quebec. The Canadian National Railway runs along this last road.

The surface of Lake Frontenac is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

The toponym "Lac Frontenac" was formalized on December 5, 1968 by the Commission de toponymie du Québec, at the creation of this commission.

Matrilineal belt

In anthropology the Matrilineal belt is an area in Africa south of the equator where matrilineality is predominant. The Matrilineal belt runs as a diagonal from the Atlantic to the Indian oceans crossing Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The belt is linked to horticultural household economics, and Bantu groups that have embraced pastoralism have tended to lose matrilinearity.

The region stands out for its high degree of paternity uncertainty and adolescent promiscuity both of which are alledged to be linked to matrilinearity. As inheritance is mainly through the descent of women, there is little incentive to know the identity of the father of a child. Men's inheritance does therefore seldom pass to his wife's children but stays within what is for sure his biological family. 

Ideas linking the Matrilineal belt to a supposed matrilineal Bantu expansion have been rejected as lacking evidence.

Death of Colten Boushie

On August 9, 2016, 22-year-old Colten Boushie died in a shooting incident in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan that drew national media attention that highlighted racial tensions in Canada.

Boushie was a resident of the Cree Red Pheasant First Nation of Saskatchewan. He and four friends drove to a farmhouse near Biggar, Saskatchewan, owned by Gerald Stanley, after getting a flat tire. They had been drinking and had earlier tried to break into a truck at another farm. One of the group tried to start up an ATV on the property and their SUV crashed into one of Stanley’s cars. Stanley reacted by retrieving a handgun from his shed and firing two warning shots into the air to scare the group off his property. Stanley then approached the SUV with Boushie in the driver's seat and reached in to turn off the ignition when his gun discharged. Boushie was shot in the neck right below the ear and died instantly. Stanley's defence claimed that this was an accident and that a third round loaded into the magazine was fired, yet failed to detonate, precipitating a hang-fire. Stanley was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. A jury acquitted him on February 9, 2018. 

The case drew significant attention and provoked debate about racism in Saskatchewan and Canada. People who supported Stanley generally perceived the trial as fair given the circumstances of events leading up to the shooting. Supporters of the Boushie family felt the trial was unfair due to the selection of what appeared to be an all-white jury. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and two cabinet ministers denounced the killing. Critics scorned these comments for politicizing the trial and discrediting the Canadian judiciary system. The mayor of Saskatoon, Charlie Clark, said the trial and its aftermath represented "a defining moment for this community and this country".

Colten Boushie (October 31, 1993 – August 9, 2016) was a resident of the Cree Red Pheasant First Nation of Saskatchewan.

According to the police ITO (Information To Obtain warrant), which was produced in August 2016 in the early stages of the investigation and was obtained by "The Globe and Mail" on August 9, 2016, twenty-two year old Colten Boushie, his girlfriend, Kiora Wuttunee, Belinda Jackson, her boyfriend, Eric Meechance, and Cassidy Cross-Whitstone, all from the Cree Red Pheasant First Nation, had spent the day swimming, drinking, and shooting in the Maymont River. Wuttunee's grey 2003 Ford Escape SUV they were riding in, got a flat tire. They had a cell phone which was used at the time of the flat tire to share text messages with friends about their escapades of the day. 

The ITO stated that Boushie's group first visited a neighbouring farm belonging to the Fouhy family, where they "attempted to steal vehicles and items" by trying to smash the window of a truck with a .22 calibre rifle. Cross-Whitstone broke the stock of the rifle in this failed attempt. They then drove on to Gerald Stanley's property near Biggar, Saskatchewan, in the Rural Municipality of Glenside No. 377, which is about from their home. 

When the SUV entered the Stanley property, the father and son were repairing a fence, while Gerald Stanley's wife Leesa was mowing the lawn not far away. The SUV occupants first entered a truck belonging to one of Gerald's customers, then mounted an ATV. Stanley's son Sheldon chased them away and smashed the Ford Escape SUV's windshield with a hammer. The SUV "crashed into Stanley's wife's car and came to a halt".

Stanley took a semi-automatic handgun from his shed, loaded it and "fired warning shots in the air" as Cross-Whitstone and Meechance ran from the ATV and fled the property. Sheldon Stanley went into the house to get his truck keys.

Gerald Stanley then approached the SUV with Boushie in the driver's seatand Jackson and Wuttunee in the back. Stanley said he saw the lawnmower his wife was using, thought she had been run over, and tried to turn off the ignition key with his left hand while holding his handgun in his right hand. He said the gun went off accidentally. He shot Boushie, whom RCMP found had a loaded .22-calibre rifle between his legs in the "back of the head at point blank range" at about 5:30 pm. Jackson and Wuttunee then assaulted Leesa Stanley.

Boushie's supporters expressed frustration with the "flawed and inadequate" police inquiry. They said the inquiry "initially focused more on the actions of the five young Indigenous people than on the killing of Mr. Boushie". The person initially in charge of the investigation was a junior constable; no forensic experts were brought in. The Ford Escape SUV where Boushie was killed, was "left uncovered, its doors open, for two rainy days, washing away evidence".

On August 10, 2016, a media release from the RCMP said, "A man was declared dead at the scene. Another man 'associated to the property' was arrested by police at the scene without incident. No charges were immediately laid. Three occupants of the vehicle—one woman, one girl and one man—were taken into custody as part of a related theft investigation, police said. Police later identified and located a fourth boy who was in the vehicle. 

This release explained that the witnesses to Boushie's killing were taken into custody "as part of a related theft investigation". None of them were charged. Because of a plea arrangement for testimony, which later turned out not to be helpful because their testimonies kept changing. 

On August 12, the Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN) representing 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, issued a media release expressing disappointment in the way the RCMP presented the shooting incident. The RCMP statement "provided just enough prejudicial information for the average reader to draw their own conclusions that the shooting was somehow justified. The messaging in an RCMP news release should not fuel racial tensions ... The media's initial portrayal of the event made the incident sound like a crime was about to be committed by the passengers in the car." The FSIN called for a review of the RCMP's communication policies and writing guidelines. The FSIN said that the "RCMP news release was biased and not in line with the relationship the FSIN and the RCMP have been building with measures such as the RCMP FSIN Partnership Protocol".

The FSIN blamed the RCMP's August 10 statement for "racially charged social media posts" that were posted on the Saskatchewan Farmers Group's Facebook pages with photos of "farmers carrying firearms". The RCMP Superintendent held a press conference requesting "residents to put their guns away". The Federation said that the RCMP media release "made it appear that Boushie's killing was justified" by the "right to defend" and that the way the RCMP shared information about the incident had fuelled racial tensions in Saskatchewan. 

On the same day, the RCMP responded to the August 12 FSIN statement.

Three days after the shooting, on August 12, 2016, "CBC News" reported that the "event had stimulated a lot of discussion on various social media platforms". Paul Dornstauder, CBC's Executive Producer for Radio Current Affairs in Saskatchewan, described how "there was a vigorous and at times rancorous debate about what had happened and why, some of which was racist". 

The article itself, published by CBC, was also the subject of investigation by CBC's ombudsman, following CBC's receipt of 25 complaints from readers concerned that "it was wrong of CBC News to publish this article, that it fed into a racist argument about Indigenous peoples that saw Mr. Boushie as a menace. It was seen as an endorsement of the use of violence by some readers." One complainant asserted that the article mistakenly linked "property rights" to Boushie's death. The complainant called the article "irresponsible and damaging" as it "could fan racist sentiment". The article has since been revised. Dornstauder described "this story as having had an electrifying effect in Saskatchewan". It is "complex and controversial", requiring sensitivity and "likely will continue to for some time to come". 

On August 15, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall called the comments "unacceptable, intolerant and a betrayal of the very values and character of Saskatchewan". He described them as "dangerous". More than five hundred comments representing both sides of the debate appeared on Wall's Facebook page in response to his remarks.

By August 17, 2016, the National Farmers Union published a statement in which they expressed their "profound sadness over the tragic shooting of Colten Boushie", and extended "deepest condolences to his family and community" and "as farmers", condemned "the rampant racist remarks that have circulated since the death of Colten Boushie, including comments made on the 'Saskatchewan Farmers' Facebook group".

Robert Innes, a University of Saskatchewan professor, described the "racial tension" in Saskatchewan as a "tinder box" with "some farmers" "blaming First Nations people for rural crime. Their mentality is to protect their property."

Gerald Stanley's bail hearing was held in North Battleford on August 18, 2016. Hundreds of people protested outside the North Battleford courthouse with RCMP on rooftops observing. On August 19, Stanley was granted bail on a $10,000 cash surety. His bail included a number of conditions, including that he stay within 6.4 kilometres of his home and that he have no contact with Boushie's family or any of the witnesses.

The trial took place from January 30, 2018, to February 9, 2018, at the Court of Queen's Bench Saskatchewan in Battleford with Saskatchewan Chief Justice Martel D. Popescul presiding.

The jury selection system allowed trial lawyers to use "peremptory challenges" to reject a limited number of potential jurors without giving a specific reason. Seven hundred fifty people were randomly summoned based on health cards for potential jury duty from the Battleford Jury Boundary, a huge area that stretches to the north of Saskatchewan. The pool which was almost double the size was enlarged to help secure a more representative jury, though only 204 of the 750 that were summoned actually showed up. Five who appeared to be First Nations were challenged by the defence, leaving what appeared to be an all-white jury. By February 11, members of the Boushie family were in Ottawa to advocate for justice. Among other things, they called for "an end to peremptory challenges in jury selection, which were used in Mr. Stanley's trial to block every potential juror who appeared to be Indigenous".

During the trial, Stanley's attorney Scott Spencer said there was "no evidence" that Stanley intentionally killed Boushie. By February 8, 2018, the jurors were deliberating on a verdict behind closed doors. Judge Popescul "warned people in the gallery about making comments during [the] tense trial" and said that "it was the first time in his long career that he had to say that in court based on a complaint from a juror".

During Judge Popescul's charge to the jury, he instructed them: "You must not find Gerald Stanley guilty unless you are sure he is guilty. Even if you believe that Mr. Stanley is probably guilty or likely guilty, that is not sufficient. In those circumstances, you must give the benefit of the doubt to Mr. Stanley and find him not guilty because the Crown has failed to satisfy you of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." He also stated "If you have a reasonable doubt about Mr. Stanley's guilt arising from the evidence, the absence of the evidence, or the credibility or the reliability of one or more of the witnesses then you must find him not guilty. In short, the presumption of innocence applies at the beginning and continues throughout the trial, unless you are satisfied after considering the whole of the evidence that the Crown has displaced the presumption of innocence by proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt."

The defence case relied heavily on the assertion that the fatal shot was unintentional and the result of a hang fire. The casing from the fatal shot had an unusual bulge which testing of the gun could not reproduce.

The gun used was a Tokarev T33 from 1947 with surplus military ammunition from 1953. The ammunition had been stored in an unheated shed where the temperature varied between 30 °C and −30 °C. Experts concluded nevertheless that the gun was functioning properly and a misfire could not be replicated during testing.

Stanley was acquitted on February 9, 2018. Since Canadian jurors are legally barred from discussing the proceedings, it is not known how the jury reached its verdict or whether the jury accepted that the gunshot that killed Boushie was hang fire.

The story attracted widespread attention from social media and mainstream media.

Following the announcement of the acquittal, about 1,000 people, including the mayor of Saskatoon, Charlie Clark, gathered at a rally at the Saskatoon court house to show support for Boushie's family and to express frustration with the acquittal. Other rallies and vigils took place in Battleford, Winnipeg, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Toronto, and Ottawa to challenge the verdict. Clint Wuttunee, Chief of the Red Pheasant First Nation, called the verdict "absolutely perverse" and stated that "an all-white jury formed the twisted view of that obvious truth and found Stanley not guilty". 

In response to the verdict, Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations's Vice-chief David Pratt, challenged the jury selection system, saying that "defence counsel used peremptory challenges to block every potential juror who appeared to be Indigenous". Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a statement on February 10, saying, "I am going to say we have come to this point as a country far too many times. Indigenous people across this country are angry, they're heartbroken and I know Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians alike know that we have to do better." Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said he would be meeting with Trudeau and with First Nations leadership. 

Canadian Justice Minister and Attorney General of Canada Jody Wilson-Raybould made a comment in a Tweet that Canada "can and must do better". Jagmeet Singh, a criminal defence lawyer and the Leader of the New Democratic Party, told reporters on February 13 that "justice was not served for Colten Boushie".

Toronto-based criminal defence lawyer Sean Robichaud said that it was "wholly inappropriate for elected officials to publicly undermine findings of a lawfully delivered verdict, particularly when it is one of a jury". He cautioned that there could be ramifications. "By commenting on a particular case, it may affect the ability for Crown to proceed with the case if an appeal is granted." Lisa Raitt, Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party, Rob Nicholson, and other Conservatives also criticized comments by Trudeau and Wilson-Raybould. 

At a press conference hosted by Saskatoon Tribal Council, Mayor Clark described the "high-profile trial and its aftermath—which included rallies across Canada—represent a defining moment for this community and this country". The Saskatoon "StarPhoenix" reported that Clark called for a "prompt reckoning across the country" as the acquittal had sparked "anxiety and anger". Many chiefs across Saskatchewan, including northern communities, travelled to Saskatoon to attend the rally. 

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) issued a statement to remind concerned parties to "conduct themselves in a peaceful and civil manner regardless of the outcome", warning that "people will be held responsible for what they say or post online and police will investigate any complaints of suspected criminal behaviour". 

On February 10, thousands attended rallies across Canada in a day-of-action activities to support Boushie's family. About 200 people gathered at Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square to protest the verdict that day. On February 12, over 300 people gathered to march from Calgary City Hall to Reconciliation Bridge, in temperatures and wind chill that felt like −28 °C, to show support for Colten Boushie's family.

By February 11, Colten Boushie's mother Debbie Baptiste, his cousin Jade Tootoosis, and uncle Alvin had travelled to Ottawa from their remote community for potential meetings with Wilson-Raybould, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale and other ministers, to advocate for justice. Along with calling for an end to peremptory challenges in the jury selection system, they are also challenging "a number of systemic problems in the justice system, as well as specific complaints arising from the way Mr. Boushie's death was investigated and prosecuted".

Mercedes-Benz OM629

The Mercedes-Benz OM628 and OM629 were 4.0-litre diesel-fuelled, 4-stroke, compression-ignition internal combustion 75° 32-valve V8 engines used in the 2000s. The world’s first aluminium V8 diesel engine for passenger car use, the engine was replaced by the OM656 straight-6 engine.

The block features an aluminium crankcase and cylinder heads. It uses aluminium sand casting in bedplate construction (divided at the height of the crankshaft) with wet cylinder liners made of cast iron. 

The main bearings are reinforced, cast in GGG ductile cast iron. Rather than the usual 90° vee angle between the cylinder banks, a 75° angle was chosen due to the space available to install the engine. The consequence of this specific angle is free inertial forces of the first order. To compensate for this, the OM628 and OM629 use a balancer shaft located in the vee of the engine. To ensure even firing intervals the crankshaft uses split crank pins.The engine uses 97.0 mm cylinder spacing.

The engine uses double overhead camshafts (DOHC) on each bank (‘quad-cam’) with four valves per cylinder, operated by hydraulic tappets. Each cylinder bank uses a variable geometry turbocharger. The compressed air from these is cooled by an air to water heat exchanger with an additional cold water circuit.

Introduced in 1999, The OM628’s capacity is 4.0L (3996cc). It uses a ‘square’ bore and stroke of 86 mm. Output varies from 250 PS to 260 PS at 4000 rpm with 560 Nm of torque at 1700-2600 rpm depending on application

The engine was used until 2005 when it was replaced by the updated OM629.

Applications

The OM629 is an updated version of the OM628 with an improved common-rail system and higher boost from the turbochargers. Still displacing 4.0L (3996cc) the engine produced between 306 PS to 320 PS at 3600 rpm and 700 Nm to 730 Nm or torque between 2000-2600 rpm.

Australian Road Research Board

Australian Road Research Board (ARRB) is an Australian research agency that provides independent, applied research and consulting services for Australian and New Zealand state road agencies and communities.

ARRB produces research in areas such as road safety, pavement engineering, climate change adaptations, road network management, and future transport technology. It also has commercial operations that provide consulting services, collecting data on roads using trucks arrayed with precise sensor equipment.

ARRB was founded in 1960, with the purpose to serve the research needs of its members (largely state road agencies), on a cost recovery basis.

ARRB put its historic Vermont South headquarters on the market in 2017, its home since the early 1970's. The sale of this land was expected to generate significant revenue with estimates ranging from $18 million to $25 million.

In 2017, ARRB appointed new state technical leaders in both Queensland and Victoria/Tasmania, Matthew Bereni and Samantha Taylor respectively. 

The Australian Road Research Board is governed by a Board of Directors, all with backgrounds or positions in major transport organisations.The Board Chairman position is held by Peter Duncan, and the position of Chief Executive Officer by Michael Caltabiano.

ARRB is in-part supported by its member organisations, who provide leadership and funding. Member organisations include federal, state and local government bodies responsible for managing the nation’s transport and road networks.

ARRB also operates with these same organisations under the collective banner of Austroads.

In July 2015, the first trials of driverless cars in the southern hemisphere were launched in Adelaide by a consortium, consisting of ARRB, Flinders University, Carnegie Mellon University, the RAA, Cohda Wireless and Bosch. Premier Jay Weatherill announced the trials, stating "Driverless cars have the ability to revolutionise transport in this country and we want to be at the forefront of that paradigm shift." 

In 2016, research published by Dr Charles Karl, ARRB national technical leader of congestion, freight and productivity, found older Australians preferred sitting in traffic congestion to catching public transport. Conversely, Australians aged 18-24 overall would rather catch public transport than wait in traffic.

ARRB, along with partners including VicRoads, Keolis Downer, La Trobe University, and RACV , launched an autonomous bus (autonobus) trial at La Trobe University's Bundoora campus in late 2017. The electric bus will begin taking passengers in 2018, as a proof of concept of a 'last-mile' solution to mobility.

In 2017, the ARRB Gala Dinner and Awards night was held on 21 July, with guest speaker Amanda Caples, PhD.

In 2018, ARRB is hosting the 28@th ARRB International Conference over 30 April to 2 May 2018, followed by the 8@th Symposium on Pavement Characteristics (SURF) over 2 May to 4 May 2018, in Brisbane, Australia, with Olympic racing cyclist Anna Meares guest speaking.

Immediately prior to these events, ARRB is hosting the inaugural ARRB Transport Hack, a hackathon event themed around the future technologies of transport, in Fortitude Valley, Queensland

She followed this with a championship record throw of to win gold at the 1979 European Athletics Junior Championships held in neighbouring Poland. This mark was latter bettered by another East German, Bettina Libera, in 1985.

Her career high came in the 1982 season. Competing for the club, she won a national title at the East German Indoor Athletics Championships, before throwing a new best of indoors. She ranked second in the world that indoor season, after Bulgaria's Verzhinia Veselinova. In Cottbus that June she achieved a lifetime best throw of . This ranked her fourth globally that year, and continues to mark her as the third best ever under-23 European thrower (behind Natalya Lisovskaya and Ilona Slupianek). This moved her up to the 12th best thrower ever at that point in time, and as of 2018 she remains in the top 25 best shot putters.

A runner-up placing to Slupianek at the East German Athletics Championships gained Schmuhl selection for the 1982 European Athletics Championships, where she placed seventh in the final.

Oellermann was born in Vryheid.
She earned a bachelor's degree, "cum laude" honours, and a master's degree at the University of Natal in 1981, 1982, and 1983 respectively,
as a student of Henda Swart.
She completed her Ph.D. in 1986 at Western Michigan University.
Her dissertation was "Generalized Connectivity in Graphs" and was supervised by Gary Chartrand.

Oellermann taught at the University of Durban-Westville, Western Michigan University, University of Natal, and Brandon University, before moving to Winnipeg in 1996. At Winnipeg, she was co-chair of mathematics and statistics for 2011–2013.

With Gary Chartrand, Oellermann is the author of the book "Applied and Algorithmic Graph Theory" (McGraw Hill, 1993).

She is also the author of well-cited research publications on metric dimension of graphs, on distance-based notions of convex hulls in graphs, and on highly irregular graphs in which every vertex has a neighborhood in which all degrees are distinct. The phrase "highly irregular" was a catchphrase of her co-author Yousef Alavi; because of this, Ronald Graham suggested that there should be a concept of highly irregular graphs, by analogy to the regular graphs, and Oellermann came up with the definition of these graphs.

In 1991, Oellermann was the winner of the annual Silver British Association Medal of the Southern Africa Association for the Advancement of Science.
She won the Meiring Naude Medal of the Royal Society of South Africa in 1994.
She was also one of three winners of the Hall Medal of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications in 1994, the first year the medal was awarded.

Conservation-restoration of Thomas Eakins' The Gross Clinic

The Conservation-restoration of Thomas Eakins' "The Gross Clinic" refers to the on-going conservation-restoration treatments of American painter Thomas Eakins' 1875 painting "The Gross Clinic" throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. These treatments are a testament to the changing methodologies undertaken in the field of paintings conservation. 

The painting portrays surgeon Dr. Samuel D. Gross performing a surgical debridement on a boy with osteomyelitis of the femur for an audience of students in his clinic at Jefferson Medical College. 

The painting was subject to several conservation-restoration treatments both prior to Eakins' death and in the decades following, which altered both the structural integrity of the painting as well as its surface composition. Emergency treatment was undertaken in 1960 and 1961 by Theodor Siegel, conservator at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, to correct damage from previous restorations. The most recent treatment was performed in 2010 by conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to correct problems resulting from the 1961 restoration as well as the previous restorations. 

"The Gross Clinic" portrays surgeon Dr. Samuel D. Gross, the first chief of surgery at Jefferson Medical College, performing surgery on a young man for osteomyelitis of the femur in the surgical amphitheater on the top floor of Jefferson's Ely Building in the company of multiple doctors and medical students. Chief of Clinic Dr. James M. Barton can be seen standing over the patient, probing the incision. Junior assistant Dr. Charles S. Briggs, seen below Gross, is holding the patient's legs while Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, uses a retractor to hold open the incision. The anesthetist, Dr. W. Joseph Hearn, sits at the head of the operating table, holding a chloroform soaked rag over the patient's face. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, records the surgery at a desk behind Gross. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell can be seen standing in the hall leading out of the amphitheater. A woman, possibly the patient's mother, can be seen recoiling at the bottom right. A self-portrait of Eakins himself can be seen on the right side of the painting, in the front of the theater, taking notes. 

Work on the painting likely began sometime in April of 1875, as evidenced by a letter from Eakins to his friend Earl Shinn in which he declares, "What elates me more is that I have just got a new picture blocked in and it is very far better than anything I have ever done." Work on the painting continued throughout summer of 1875, with Eakins holding multiple sessions with Dr. Gross at his home at 1729 Mount Vernon St. to produce studies for the final work. The work was likely finished by Christmas of 1875, evidenced by the gift of a portrait sketch of author and friend Robert C.V. Meyers, who modeled for the painting.

Eakins submitted the painting for display at Memorial Hall during the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, but was rejected by Selecting Committee, who claimed there was inadequate space to display the painting. However, it was suggested by a correspondent of New York's "Medical Record" and by William Clark in the "Philadelphia Evening Telegraph" that the painting's graphic nature caused several members of the jury to feel faint. The painting was instead displayed at the model ward of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a replica created for the Centennial.

In February of 1878 the painting was purchased by Alumni Association of Jefferson Medical College for $200.

On November 11th, 2006 it was announced that the board of Thomas Jefferson University (formerly Jefferson Medical College) voted to sell the painting to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and to Wal-Mart heiress Alice Walton's planned Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas for a record $68 million. 

Due to the painting's connections to Philadelphia, portraying Philadelphians painted in a Philadelphia college by a Philadelphia painter, the announcement of the impending sale caused an uproar. Anne d’Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, remarked that “It’s a painting that really belongs in Philadelphia — his presence still resonates here.” Protests against the sale held in November and December of 2006 were organized by Philadelphia artists Stanley Bielen, Charles Cushing, and Patrick Connors. Philadelphia mayor John F. Street threatened to declare the painting a historic landmark, possibly tying up the sale in court.

The university gave local museums and government agencies the chance to match the $68 million sale price and keep the painting in Philadelphia by December 26th, 2006. In a joint effort by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the funds were raised in 45 days through thousands of donations with the remaining amount loaned by Wachovia Bank. The remainder of the funding was completed in 2008 by the Philadelphia Museum of Art's sale of "Cowboy Singing" and two oil sketches of "Cowboys in the Badlands" and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts sale of "The Cello Player," all works by Eakins.

The first recorded conservation-restoration treatment to "The Gross Clinic" took place sometime in 1915 by restorer T. H. Stevenson at the behest of Jefferson Medical College. The canvas on which "The Gross Clinic" was painted had become weak and brittle and was lined with a new piece of linen. A 1916 issue of "The Jeffersonian" noted that Stevenson cleaned and treated the painting.

At some point between 1917 and 1925 a treatment of the painting took place that dramatically altered the composition of the painting. It is not known who worked on the painting or when. A comparison of a photograph of the painting taken in October of 1917 for the "Loan Exhibition of the Works of Thomas Eakins" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a reproduction of the painting that appeared as the frontispiece of Jefferson Medical College's 1925 yearbook show major differences in the relative tones of the painting, indicating a major restoration in which paint was removed. The hall leading out of the amphitheater was considerably lighter; Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell originally appeared lighter than the background. The majority of the painting now had a considerably redder tone.

Thomas Eakins' widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins, upon seeing the 1925 reproduction and thinking the changes had been made for the reproduction rather than to the painting itself, strongly objected to its release. A letter from Eakins to Jefferson Medical College Dean Ross V. Patterson details her frustrations:
The next recorded treatment of the painting took place in 1940 was by Philadelphia restorer Hannah Mee Horner, at the behest of Jefferson Medical College. Hearing of the college's plans for restoring the painting, Eakins' student Charles Bregler,who frequently treated multiple Eakins paintings at Susan Eakins request, attempted to intervene but was rebuffed. Horner removed the linen lining attached by Stevenson in 1915 and replaced it with two, 4 by 6 1/2 foot pieces of plywood which were butted in the center and nailed to a wooden framework. The painting was then attached using carpenter's glue. Records also indicate that Horner also cleaned and restored the painting.

The results of the 1940 treatment proved to be disastrous and put the painting in serious need of new treatment. In the spring of 1960 conservator Theodor Siegl of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the first with professional training and credentials to treat the painting, cleaned and restored the painting at Jefferson's request. Varnish, applied by Horner, had become yellowed and darkened while a significant accumulations of grime also built up on the surface. Siegl used a combination of solvents to remove the grime and varnish, removed build up of filling putty used by previous restorers, and retouched areas that had been torn or distorted. Siegl finally applied a layer of varnish and made minor retouchings. 

In 1961 Jefferson again requested Siegl examine the painting prior to its inclusion in an Eakins retrospective that would travel from the National Gallery of Art to the Art Institute of Chicago and finally end in Philadelphia. Siegl realized that the structure of the painting was in extreme danger from Horner's 1940 treatment. The plywood attached to the back of the painting had begun to warp, creating a crease in the middle of the painting which could have torn it in half. The nails in the plywood also began to move forward, creating bumps in the painting. 

Siegl's conservation-restoration of the painting moved forward in the summer of 1961. Due to the paintings large size, no table in the conservation department could accommodate the painting, thus a custom working platform with a built in thermostat was created. To protect the painting in the course of removing the plywood the surface of the painting was covered with tissue paper and strips of muslin. The framework was the first part of the 1940 treatment to be removed, revealing over 500 nails which had been causing a large portion of the damage to the painting's surface. A planer, attached to an electric power saw, was used to remove most of the plywood, with the remainder being removed by hand. The carpenter's glue used in the 1940 was then removed. A new linen lining was attached to the canvas, which was then attached to a new stretcher framework. A new, easily removable varnish was used on the painting's surface. 

Following the purchase of "The Gross Clinic" by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2007 and after considerable research and discussion, the decision was made to conserve and restore the painting once more. The ultimate goal of the treatment was to both correct damage done by earlier treatments and restore the tones of the paint to reflect Eakins original intentions, which was made possible my extensive research on Eakins technique not available to earlier conservators. This treatment was performed by conservators Mark Tucker, Allen Kosanovich, and Terry Lignelli. 

The first step concerned the removal of the varnish applied by Siegl in 1961, a synthetic resin called poly(n-butyl methacrylate), which was prone to discoloration and loss of solubility, making it more difficult to remove as time went on. Taking place over the course of several weeks, the removal of this varnish allowed conservators to view what was left of Eakins original paint and what had been retouched by earlier treatments. A new, synthetic resin varnish, MS2A, was applied to the surface which both evenly saturated the colors of the painting while isolating the original paint from the retouching, should it need to be removed in the future.

A 1875-1876 india ink and watercolor reproduction created by Eakins, the 1917 photograph, and 1925 reproduction were used as a guide for conservators to retouch the painting. The conservators used paints made of lightfast pigments ground in a colorless synthetic resin to retouch the painting. Smaller areas where paint had been flaked away were the first priority, followed by areas where large swaths of colors and tones had been altered. The area of the amphitheater's opening, in which a dark glaze had been removed, was restored to more closely resemble the small amounts of dark paint that remained as well as the 1917 photograph. Details of the many characters in the painting had been obscured due to earlier aggressive cleanings. The faces of orderly Hughey O'Donnell, Dr. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross, and Eakins were all restored to their original detail seen in the 1917 photograph.

Following the completion of the treatment an exhibition, "An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing The Gross Clinic Anew", was held between July 23, 2010 and January 9, 2011 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

The use of x-radiography and infrared reflectography prior to the 2010 treatment revealed a wealth of information about Eakins' technique and the creation of "The Gross Clinic".

An x-radiograph of the painting revealed a heavy build-up of paint behind the heads of the principal characters. Rather than building upon dark areas with light paint, as was the convention at the time of the paintings creation, the x-radiograph revealed that Eakins instead built on light areas with dark paint. The characters featured in the periphery of the painting were not significantly built up in this fashion and were instead painted thinly. 

Significant changes in the composition of the painting before the final image were revealed using x-radiography. The probe in the hands of Dr. James Barton was initially longer but shortened in the final composition. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, was initially seen taking his notes at a lower position but was moved up for the final composition. Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, is shown in the sketch looking more to the right but in the final composition looking more to the left, showing more of his profile. In the final composition his arm was also moved slightly down, showing the patient's buttocks. X-radiography also revealed an initial stripe across the bottom of the painting, likely intended to serve as the wall circling the seats of the amphitheater, which was replaced with a view under the surgeon's table in the final composition.

Following the completion of the 2010 conservation treatment, the Philadelphia Museum of Art opened the exhibition "An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing "The Gross Clinic" Anew", which ran from July 3, 2010 to January 9, 2011. The theme of the exhibition was "Then and Now", an homage to the famed and nearly two hour long lecture by Dr. Samuel D. Gross, "Then and Now: Advances in Medical Science in the Past Forty Years: a Discourse Introductory to the Forty-third Course of Lectures in the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia". The first gallery was in the style of a salon, with "The Gross Clinic" presented in the middle, flanked by "The Agnew Clinic" and "Professor Benjamin Howard Rand" on the left and right, respectively. The second gallery contained information regarding the conservation history of the painting, including the findings from the research undertaken prior to the conservation, the damage caused by the early restorations, and the 2010 treatment which restored the painting. The final gallery presented a documentary film which told the story of the paintings acquisition in 2007 and subsequent conservation. Visitors were then directed to revisit "The Gross Clinic" a second time, having contextualized its treatment.

Nakayama Shōzen

Nakayama Shōzen (中山 正善, April 23, 1905 – November 14, 1967) was the second Shinbashira of Tenrikyo. He was the first son of Nakayama Shinnosuke, the first Shinbashira, and the great-grandson of Nakayama Miki, the foundress of Tenrikyo.

Nakayama Shōzen was born on April 23, 1905 in what is now Tenri, Nara, Japan. He was born to parents Nakayama Shinnosuke and Tamae.

On January 21, 1915, at the age of ten, Shōzen was installed as the Shinbashira. However, due to Nakayama's young age, the duties of the office were conducted by Yamazawa Tamenobu. In 1923, Shōzen entered Osaka High School. In 1925, he founded the Tenri Foreign Language School, the predecessor to Tenri University, and installed as its principal. Later in the same year, he assumed all of the responsibilities of the Shinbashira office.

In 1926, Shōzen graduated from Osaka High School and entered the religious studies department at University of Tokyo. The department chair at the time was Prof. Anesaki Masaharu, who today is considered the father of religious studies in Japan. Shōzen's graduation thesis, titled "On Missionary Work" (伝道について "Dendō ni tsuite"), was an analysis of questionnaire results that were solicited from Tenrikyo church head ministers and missionaries regarding the state of Tenrikyo's missionary activities at the time. His thesis was later edited and published by Tenrikyo Doyusha as "Tenrikyō dendōsha ni kansuru chōsa" in 1930. He graduated from University of Tokyo in 1929.

He also worked extensively on the sci-fi series "Charlie Jade". He has also made several short films over the years, inbetween television assignments.

His first foray into fiction novels, "The Circle Cast: The Lost Years of Morgan le Fay", was published in 2010. It's a retelling of the Arthurian legend, focusing on the rise of Morgan le Fay, the powerful witch and eventual nemesis of King Arthur, set in Roman-era Britain.

In addition to screenwriting and novels, Epstein is also a screenwriting teacher. "Crafty Screenwriting: Writing Movies That Get Made" was a screenwriting manual, for feature films, derived from Epstein's career in development. Next, Epstein wrote "Crafty TV Writing: Thinking Inside the Box", in 2006. This book focused on his experiences in television and guiding writers in crafting series and pilots that would sell and get them staffed. There is also a tie-in blog, entitled "Complications Ensue".

Measurements of Earth Data for Environmental Analysis

The Measurements of Earth Data for Environmental Analysis (MEDEA) was a post-Cold-War project of the intelligence community of the United States to leverage US global surveillance records and capabilities for the scientific study of climate change.

In 1992, at the behest of the Council on Foreign Relations and then-Senator Al Gore and with the direction of Director of Central Intelligence Robert Gates, the Environmental Task Force (ETF) was formed, which in 1993 became MEDEA. More than 860,000 historical satellite photographs were analyzed by a group of dozens of scientists and new satellite photographs were captured and declassified.

The program was shut down early in the George W. Bush administration, re-started in 2010 under the Obama administration, and concluded in 2015.

2006 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 2006 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 81st year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

The 2005 English Greyhound Derby champion Westmead Hawk became only the fourth greyhound in history to win the Derby for a second time emulating the achievement of Mick the Miller (1929 & 1930), Patricias Hope (1972 & 1973) and Rapid Ranger (2000 & 2001). Returning from winter rest the Nick Savva trained greyhound lost to Fear Me, in the final of the BGRB Scottish Derby before creating his own piece of history.

Westmead Hawk suffered a serious injury later in the year which resulted in him missing the 2006 Irish Greyhound Derby, an event that was won by Razldazl Billy trained by Dolores Ruth. Westmead Hawk was duly voted the Greyhound of the Year. Charlie Lister was Greyhound Trainer of the Year.

Rye House Stadium, built in 1935, closed for good on the 15 November, just two years after re-opening. 

The battle between the countries two top staying (longer distance) greyhounds continued; Greenacre Lin defeated Roxholme Girl in the Golden Jacket final and then Roxholme Girl gained revenge by winning the William Hill TV Trophy. Greenacre Lin won the Cesarewitch and then Roxholme Girl headed for Manchester and claimed victory in the Gold Collar. They both bypassed the Grand Prix which was won by January Tiger trained by Mark Wallis, who had five of the finalists. Greenacre Lin was retired form racing in September and was voted stayer of the year.

GRA track Wimbledon lost four trainers during the course of the year. Seamus Cahill and Paul Garland both moved to Walthamstow Stadium followed by Ray Peacock and John Walsh leaving for Romford and Harlow respectively. Two replacements were Jason Foster from Oxford and Paul Donovan from Reading Stadium.

Walthamstow also appointed new trainers in Peter Rich from and Kelly Mullins (son of Linda Mullins). Coincidentally earlier in the year Kelly's brother John Mullins had left Walthamstow to concentrate solely on operating an open-race kennel at Capel St. Mary. Oxford's leading trainer Nick Colton joined sister track Hall Green.

Harold Rosen (mayor)

Harold Rosen (December 30, 1925 – January 16, 2018) was an American lawyer and politician. Rosen first became acting Mayor of Miami Beach, Florida, in 1974 following the death of his predecessor, Mayor Chuck Hall, who died in office. He ultimately served as Mayor from 1974 until 1977. Rosen credited with beginning the revitalization of Miami Beach, notably by abolishing rent control in 1976, a move that was highly controversial at the time.

Rosen was born to Joseph and Roslyn Rosen on December 30, 1925, in Watertown, New York. He was raised in Watertown and nearby Carthage, New York. Rosen received his bachelor's degree from St. Lawrence University in New York. He enlisted in the United States Navy and served in both World War II and the Korean War.

Rosen moved to Miami Beach in 1948 and enrolled at University of Miami School of Law in nearby Coral Gables, where obtained his law degree in 1952. He became licensed to practice law in Florida on April 14, 1952. His specialties included governmental and administrative law, as well as commercial and construction litigation.

By the early 1970s, Harold Rosen had become an influential figure in Miami Beach due to his roles as a lawyer and city commissioner. Rosen had risen to the office of vice-mayor of Miami Beach by 1974, when incumbent Mayor Chuck Hall died in office, leaving an unexpected vacancy for the city's chief executive. In response to Hall's death, city commissioners had to choose a successor and became deadlocked. Rosen, the vice-mayor who was not believed to have aspirations to become mayor prior in 1974, volunteered for the position. In 2011 interview with Florida International University, Rosen recalled the moment saying, "So I said to these guys, I'm gonna be the mayor, I’ll take the job...who's gonna vote against me? And I became the mayor." He went on to serve as Mayor from 1974 until 1977 (including a full two-year term from 1975 to 1977). 

Rosen inherited a city facing a number of pressing issues during the 1970s, including urban decay, poverty, a large elderly population, and rent control. During his mayoral tenure, Rosen is credited with beginning the transformation from a declining city into the world-known destination that Miami Beach is known for today. According to Seth Bramson, a history professor at Barry University, "Harold Rosen started the renaissance...He brought a great sense of optimism to Miami Beach."

One of Rosen's most controversial - and applauded - proposals was to eliminate rent control, a policy meant to protect Miami Beach's elderly residents, but also imposed price ceilings on landlords and property owners. Rosen originally proposed the abolition of rent control in 1970 while he was still a city commissioner. The response was swift and negative from residents. Rosen recalled that "all the old people" were angry at the idea and worried about potential rent increases. Rosen did not care at the time, later saying, "The commissioners at that time... they didn't want to go against the vote [for future elections]. I couldn’t care less because I didn’t wanna go any higher beyond the city commission. So it never bothered me."

Rosen once again proposed the idea to eliminate rent control once he became mayor. This time, Rosen managed to find the commissioner votes needed to abolish the rent regulation. Miami Beach city commissioners narrowly voted to eliminate rent control in a 4-3 vote in 1976 in a victory for Rosen. However, the move proved highly controversial. Still, in 1977 the Florida Legislature also voted to eliminate rent controls in the state. A number of pro-rent control lawsuits followed, but these odinances were largely struck down by a series of court rulings during the 1980s.

Rosen presided over an urban renewal project during the 1970s in an area south of Sixth Street which proved less successful. In 1973, the city government had passed a moratorium on so-called "unplanned development" in the neighborhood, which was home to some of Miami Beach's oldest buildings. This led to the property values of apartment buildings and hotels to stagnate or decline, which led to some of the structures falling into disrepair. The city, under Rosen, then sought to demolish more 372 structures in the neighborhood, which required Florida state approval that the neighborhood be declared blighted. The city commission ultimately declared the area blighted and in decay, despite opposition from then-State's Attorney for Dade County Janet Reno and Miami Beach residents. Years later, Rosen regretted the blight designation and demolitions, telling the "Miami Herald", "It wasn't that blighted. That was just a word we had to use. Some parts of it were bad, but the majority was good. I think we just wanted to change the image. It was becoming a lot of small co-ops for the elderly and we didn’t want a retirement community for the elderly...Regrettably, there’s been a tremendous price."

In addition to his work as an attorney, Rosen was also a registered lobbyist. He helped a construction firm secure a $200 million in public right-of-way project contract in 2001, which was the largest public contract in Miami Beach's history at the time.

By the mid-2010s, Rosen was serving as an attorney for the City of Miami Beach Visitors and Convention Authority. 

Harold Rosen died on January 16, 2018, at the age of 92. He was survived by his wife of forty-two years, Judie Rosen; sister, Fay Friedland; two children; ten grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. His funeral was held at Temple Emanu-El in Miami Beach on January 19, 2018.

<doc id="56562025" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56562025" title="Ronald MacKeith">
Ronald MacKeith

Ronald Charles MacKeith (23 February 1908-30 October 1977) - 30 October 1977) BA, MA, BM BCh, DCH Lond, DM, MRCP, FRCP was a British paediatrician. MacKeith was prolific in his endeavours. He was principally known for establishing the first cerebral palsy advice clinic, which was to become in 1964, the larger and more comprehensive Newcomen Centre for handicapped children in Guy's Hospital. He founded the British Paediatric Neurology Association and the medical journal, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology. His work gained recognition of the field of paediatric neurology as a science in several European countries.

MacKeith came from a very large family, who along with his twin sister, was third to last, in a family of 11 children. His childhood was seemingly serendipitous, having a father who was the GP Alexander Arthur MacKeith, and his mother, Alice, who was the daughter of a Pharmaceutical manufacturer.

He started his studies at King Edward VI School, Southampton, subsequently moving to The Queen's College, Oxford in 1926, receiving a Bachelor of Arts and then a Master of Arts by 1930. He was then offered a position to start his clinical studies at St Mary's Hospital Medical School in 1932. MacKeith was offered a position as house officer at St Mary's.

After working for a year, as a house officer, he spent the next year abroad as a Radcliffe travelling fellow. During that period he worked at the pediatric department of Bellevue Hospital, New York. During the interwar period, he held a number of junior positions, before finally being employed with Hector Charles Cameron at St James' Hospital, Balham towards the start of World War II. He spent the beginning of the war at St James, working through The Blitz, as Balham and indeed Wandsworth was being bombed extensively by Germany. In 1942 MacKeith decided to "join up" and from 1942 to 1945 was placed Royal Navy to work as a medical officer. He left at the end of the war with the rank of surgeon lieutenant commander.

After the war, he worked at Great Ormond Street Hospital as a supernumerary registrar, MacKeith was assigned a problem in paediatrics, by his consultant, Sir Alan Moncrieff. Moncrieff was looking for research to be conducted, on a previously researched problem of some importance, threadworn infestations in children. Although most failed to solve the problem, Moncrieff managed to, determining the epidemiology of threadworms and formulating a diagnosis, that is still valid today. He later conducted trials with the drug piperazine to determine it's efficacy.

He later moved to Guy's hospital, where two of his brothers were trained. In 1958 he was appointed Children's Physician several days before the start of the National Health Service. It was Guys where MacKeith's enduring notability was established, when he persuaded the hospital to permit parental visiting every day, instead of the usual habit of twice per week. This became established practice in the United Kingdom and abroad. He established the first cerebral palsy advice clinic, which was to become in 1964, the larger and more comprehensive Newcomen Centre for handicapped children in Guy's Hospital, becoming its first director, and later being joined by Mary Sheridan. The unit was established is a disused Victorian pub, located just outside the back gate. Access was by a steep winding stair, in which disabled children were carried, or occasionally climbed with dogged determination, which never "curbed" the enthusiasm of the staff. The centre eventually became too small and moved into Portakabins at the foot of Guys Tower. MacKeith, or Ronnie to his staff, remained there until he retired in 1974.

MacKeith's most significant influence on paediatric practice was his gentle, modern and compassionate treatment of handicapped children while attending hospital and at home. He publicly supported a holistic inter-disciplinary approach, seeing the whole family, rather than the child and the disability. While formulating this approach, he wrote and collaborated on writing several books on the subject, along with several articles in Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology. During this period, he also consulted at the Cassel Hospital, being appointed in 1950 and appointed in 1960 to the Tavistock Clinic.

In the 1950s, MacKeith became director of the medical communications department of the National Spastics Society (now SCOPE), a position he held until his death. He founded the "Cerebral Palsy Bulletin" during February 1958, which later grew by 1962, into the Journal of Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology. He recorded a series of Monographs called the "Clinics in Developmental Medicine" that were recordings of his study group at Oxford called the "International Study Group on Child Neurology". These became associated with the journal from 1958 to 1972 and were widely read in the Paediatric community.


In 1972 he was awarded the James Spence Medal gold medal named in honour of the war paediatrician Professor Sir James Calvert Spence. In 1974 he received the Rosén von Rosenstein Medal of the Swedish Paediatric Association, named after the Swedish pioneer in paediatrics, Nils Rosén von Rosenstein. In 1975 he was awarded the Special Merit Award of the American Academy for Cerebral Palsy. MacKeith was awarded the Albrecht von Haller Medal from the University of Gottingen, that is named after the Albrecht von Haller, the father of modern physiology.

NOAA Weather Radio broadcast routine

The NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards network has a multi-tier concept for forecasting or alerting the public to all types of weather. Actual forecasts vary by the area that the transmitter serves. During severe weather situations, Watch Information Statements for government-designated jurisdictions served by the local NWR station are typically inserted within the station's normal playlist of routine products; a special severe weather playlist temporarily suspends most regularly scheduled routine products in the event National Weather Service-issued warnings (mainly severe thunderstorm, tornado or flash flood warnings) are in effect for the station's broadcast area, which solely incorporate watch, warning and Special Weather Statements, and any active Short-Term Forecasts and Hazardous Weather Outlooks.

Unless there is a significant event or test occurring, the typical broadcast cycle includes the following:

A typical hourly observation report, which is updated once (or twice depending on the station or National Weather Service office, or whether severe weather conditions are ongoing) per hour at 5 or 10 and at 15 minutes past the hour, heard over NOAA Weather Radio stations features the following information:


Conditions for the closest observation site are typically used as a substitute in the lead of the segment if no report is available from the main reporting station, in which case the substituted station's observations will not be repeated at the end of the segment. In some locales, in the event any weather reporting station (whether the main station or a distant site) whose condition reports are regularly included in the segment had absent data, or no data available, the following message would be played in its place:In some areas, a major city featured within the regional observations would always provide weather conditions; if a condition report is unavailable, the message "the weather conditions were not available" would precede the city. In addition, the regional portion of the segment may be condensed to a roundup format for select or all cities, if temperatures are within a 5° range and/or if sky conditions are the same or differ limitedly at each given reporting site (for example: "skies ranged from sunny to mostly sunny, and temperatures were between 57 and 62 degrees"). Sky conditions and/or temperatures for individual weather reporting stations may only be mentioned if weather conditions differ between multiple locations.
Occasionally, due to technical or other issues, the previous hour's observations segment may be included in the product playlist as long as 15 minutes into the next hour, after which it is removed until updated information is available.

Here is an example taken from NOAA Weather Radio station WXJ75 in Springfield Illinois, at 8:00 a.m. on September 7, 2017. The Weather Radio Audio generator interprets the Area Weather Roundup below to generate this text for the Springfield Weather Radio Transmitter:
The product below then translates temperatures from programmed sites at the following sites: Peoria, Bloomington, Champaign, Decatur, Lincoln, Taylorville, Litchfield, Jacksonville, and Quincy. It is translated:
The observations for Springfield are then re-emphasized:
Then every cycle between :05 and :59 of each hour, observations from Chicago, Indianapolis, Saint Louis, Kansas City, Des Moines, and Milwaukee are provided as interpreted from the Area Weather Roundup product shown below:
Generation of this segment usually takes longer, as the Kansas City report requires the product to interpret another Area Weather Roundup product issued by the National Weather Service office in Springfield, MO.

When conditions warrant, a hazardous weather outlook is issued (usually twice each day at around 7:00 a.m. and noon local time) by a local weather forecast office addressing potentially hazardous weather affecting the next seven days. The outlook will include information about potential thunderstorm activity (including any areas forecast to be under threat of severe thunderstorms), heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, wildfire, extremes of heat or cold, or other conditions that may pose a hazard or threat to travel, life and/or property.
It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event, along with a call for action for NWS-trained SKYWARN volunteer weather spotters to be prepared to report their local weather conditions and/or damage reports back to the local NWS office. Other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Public Severe Weather Outlook. Occasionally, a NWS WFO may update the Hazardous Weather Outlook while an event is ongoing or if forecast models denote changes from previous forecasts.
Depending on the Weather Forecast Office, the Hazardous Weather Outlook may either state all weather hazards for the seven-day period or may separate them by the current day and the succeeding six days (days two through seven) of the forecast period.

The following example of a Hazardous Weather Outlook was issued by the National Weather Service in North Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 24, 2011:
Source:

The regional weather synopsis, also known as the "regional weather summary" (the terminology varies depending on the local National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office), is a report that provides a brief overview of weather events from the previous or current day within the region, followed by an outlook of expected weather from the current time to the next few days. The synopsis is usually broadcast in the main program cycle and updated at least twice per day from 5:00 to 11:00 a.m. and 4:00 to 10:00 p.m. local time.

The following example of a Regional Weather Synopsis was issued by the NWS Fort Worth office, on April 2, 2010:

In most cases, this information is included in the above regional weather synopsis. climate summaries comprise three separate general information products illustrating recently observed weather conditions:

This product offers weather summaries for all the counties across the listening area. It is updated four times daily at 4:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 3:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. (but more during severe or changeable weather).

A regional weather roundup is updated hourly. Regional weather conditions are summarised at predetermined times.

There is also a three- to five-day extended forecast product, which is updated twice per day at sometime between 1:00 and 3:00 p.m.

The following are not included during most broadcast cycles or are only played as needed depending on local weather.

A short term forecast is a localized, event-driven report used to provide the public with detailed weather information during significant and/or rapidly changing weather conditions during the next six hours. This forecast will often mention the position of precipitation as detected by radar. In most areas, this is the only forecast product that is permitted to air both during active severe weather warnings affecting the listening area "and" during routine forecast program cycles.

A special weather statement is a regional event-driven and is used to provide the public with details of the upcoming significant weather event, such as a major winter storm, a heat wave, or potential flooding. A significant weather advisory may be issued within a Special Weather Statement, often if thunderstorm activity whether severe or not is occurring in, or approaching an area.

The following example of a special weather statement was issued by the National Weather Service office in San Angelo, Texas, on September 6, 2010 regarding that year's Tropical Storm Hermine:

A record information announcementannounces information on newly set records for coldest/warmest maximum and/or minimum temperature and maximum precipitation. This forecast is only included in the broadcast when such events occur.

A Surf zone forecast is a text forecast for local beaches issued by coastal stations, including coastal hazard information such as that pertaining to rip currents. These products are issued year-round at the Los Angeles/Oxnard, San Diego and New York City offices, and seasonally at most other coastal offices.

This forecast is not usually included in many reports unless there is a potential for flooding or flooding is occurring, which would then be included with the hazardous weather outlook
Daily river forecasts are issued by the 13 river forecast centers using hydrologic models based on variables such as rainfall, soil characteristics and precipitation forecasts. Some forecasts, especially those in mountainous regions, also provide seasonal snow pack and peak flow forecasts.
A separate forecast, "River and Small Stream Observations", is broadcast in areas in and outside the 13 river forecast centers and is only broadcast following a significant hydrological event featuring information on crests, and present and forecasted flood stages.

Lake forecasts (sometimes referred to as "nearshore marine forecasts" and "open waters forecast"; depending on the station and area) are issued by most stations in the Great Lakes region to explicitly state expected weather conditions within the marine forecast area through the next five days. The report addresses expected wave heights and small-craft advisories currently in effect.

A Coastal Waters Forecast states expected weather conditions and wave heights within the marine forecast area through the next five days.

An offshore waters forecast is issued by the Ocean Prediction Center and provides a five-day forecast and warning information intended for mariners travelling on oceanic waters adjacent to the U.S. coastline.

Tropical weather summaries are an event-driven report updated every three hours, which provides an information summary on any active tropical cyclones. Activity summaries for the Atlantic Basin are typically included with stations located in states near the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean, while stations along the West Coast receive summaries concerning the Pacific Ocean. Depending on the station and associated Weather Forecast Office, listeners can hear this report at the top and bottom of every hour.

Su Bingqi

Su Bingqi (; 1909 – 30 June 1997) was a Chinese archaeologist and co-founder of Peking University's archaeology program. He was China's major archaeological theoretician for 50 years, and regarded in his later years as the paramount authority in the archaeology of China. He was best known for his "regional systems and cultural types" (区系类型) model of Chinese Neolithic cultural development, which rejected the traditional view of Chinese culture radiating from the core Central Plain region and has been widely adopted. It was further developed by Kwang-chih Chang as the Chinese Interaction Sphere model.

Su was born in 1909 in Gaoyang County, Hebei Province. From 1928 to 1934 he studied history at Beijing Normal University. After graduation he joined the Institute of Historical Studies of the Peiping Academy (a predecessor of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and its excavation team at the Doujitai archaeological site in Baoji, Shaanxi Province, where he spent three years, from 1934 to 1937, under the guidance of senior archaeologist Xu Xusheng, who had a significant influence on him. Su completed the excavation report in 1945, but it was published only in 1948.

In 1940 Su wrote a book analyzing the types of "li" (鬲) pottery tripods excavated at Doujitai, but lost the manuscript in the chaos of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some of the contents were published in his excavation report, but it took 40 years before an abridged version of the study was finally published. The book was highly regarded as "probably the most ambitious and systematic project of pottery typology" in Chinese archaeology. Su used "li" vessel typology to determine ethnic affiliations of archaeological sites, and his methodology has been adopted by generations of Chinese scholars.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Su became a fellow of the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (under the Chinese Academy of Sciences until 1977). In 1952 he co-founded China's first university archaeology program at Peking University, then under the Department of History, where he trained many of China's leading archaeologists who have been greatly influenced by him. After the death of Xia Nai, Su was elected to succeed him as President of the Chinese Archaeology Association in 1986.

Su Bingqi died on 30 June 1997. In 2005, his biography, written by his son Su Kaizhi (苏恺之), was published by Joint Publishing.

After the disruption to academic research caused by the Cultural Revolution, in 1979 Su proposed the influential "regional systems and cultural types" (区系类型) model of Chinese Neolithic cultural development (published in 1981 in the journal "Wenwu"). Rejecting the traditional point of view that the Central Plain (Yellow River valley) was the cradle of Chinese civilization and radiated out to backward regions in the rest of China, Su argued that archaeological data had proven that ancient cultures were developing simultaneously in multiple regions and influenced each other, including the Central Plain.

Many scholars, especially Su's students, consider the multi-region model his most important theoretical contribution. In the view of Li Feng of Columbia University, although the theory "does little more than synthesize what had already been revealed by the extensive archaeological work" of the recent past, it was a powerful tool for analyzing prehistoric development in Neolithic China. According to archaeologist Kwang-chih Chang of Harvard University, Su's theory legitimized a view of ancient China that had been regarded as heresy. Based on Su's model, Chang developed the model of "Chinese Interaction Sphere" in 1986. Their theories have since been widely accepted in academia.

Caroline Quarlls (1824-1892) was the first enslaved person to travel through Wisconsin using the Underground Railroad. She reached Canada and freedom in 1842.
Quarlls was born in St. Louis, Missouri in 1824. In 1842 she was able to escape Missouri by passing as a white girl and purchasing a ticket for a steamboat to Alton, Illinois. There was a bounty on her and she was pursued through Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Michigan. She avoided capture by sheltering with abolitionists until she made her way into Canada.

Harini Iyengar

Harini Iyengar is an English Barrister and Governing Bencher of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple and on the steering group of the Temple Women’s Forum. She is based at 11 King's Bench Walk (11KBW) Law Chambers.

Harini Iyengar was born and raised in Manchester, England, where her Indian immigrant parents were both NHS doctors.

Iyengar attended Manchester Grammar School and then went on to read law at Brasenose College, Oxford where she debated in the Oxford Union. Her thesis was in Freedom of Assembly and she matriculated from Brasenose in 1993.

Iyengar was called to the Bar in 1999 when she was seven months pregnant.

Following a high profile case of a temporary receptionist, Nicola Thorp, being sent home unpaid after she refused to follow the dress code at the office of accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers and wear high heels, a petition was submitted to the House of Commons and Iyengar gave evidence. At the joint petition hearing between the Petitions Committee and the Women and Equalities Committee into "High Heels and Workplace Dress Codes" Iyengar said that, "I think that if you came before the tribunal you would have pleaded both direct and indirect sex discrimination in both cases, and it depends really whether we want to modernise what we regard as conventional dress."

Iyengar has also commentated in the media on high profile cases including: plans to force large firms to disclose data on the gender pay gap among staff ("Sky News") the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations ("Newsnight"); and sexual harassment in the workplace ("ITV News at Ten").

As a post-graduate student Harini stood for the Labour Party at 1997 Oxfordshire County Council local election, two years later as a working single mother she "found that none of the old parties spoke to me or for me and ... became disillusioned and alienated from politics for many years."

Iyengar stood for the Women's Equality Party (WEP) in the Greater London Assembly elections in May 2016, and at their first party conference in November 2016 she was elected to Policy Committee as Spokesperson on Equal Representation. 

At the General Election, 2017 Harini stood for WEP in Vauxhall.

Iyengar is standing in the Dalston ward of Hackney in the local council election and as a mayoral candidate in the election for Mayor of Hackney both elections are to be held 3 May 2018.

To mark the 40th anniversary of the admission of women into Brasenose College the student committee (JCR Committee) commissioned twelve portraits of past female students. Nominations were sought from past alumni for Brasenose women they believed to be inspiring and extraordinary. Nearly 200 nominations were received and divided into various categories of fields of work. The JCR committee then voted to select the final shortlist of twelve subjects. The twelve, including Iyengar, were then photographed by portrait photographer Bill Knight.




Iyengar is a single mother to three children.

The ridge formed as an island arc when the Cayman Trough was the site of a subduction zone during the Paleocene and Eocene epochs. As the dynamics of the area changed, the subduction zone became a transform fault zone with a pull-apart basin during which time volcanism had dwindled along the entire length of the arc. The Cayman Ridge is now an inactive volcanic zone.

Royal L. Bolling

Royal Lee Bolling (1920-2002) was a Massachusetts politician and head of a prominent African-American political family. While serving in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1965, he sponsored the state's Racial Imbalance Act, which led to the desegregation of Boston's public schools. 

Bolling was a decorated World War II veteran, earning a Silver Star as a member of the segregated "Buffalo Soldiers" 92nd infantry division. He was also the founder of a successful real estate business, which he ran for 50 years.

Bolling was born in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, to Granville and Irene Bolling. At the age of eight, he moved with his family to Framingham, Massachusetts. He grew up in a small yellow house on Walnut Street near Bowditch Field. He first showed a talent for politics when he ran for president of his predominantly white Framingham High School class and obtained endorsements from Massachusetts governor Leverett Saltonstall and Boston Mayor James Michael Curley. He became the school's first African-American class president and was re-elected twice before graduating in 1940.

He attended Howard University for a time, performing as a tap dancer in D.C.-area nightclubs to earn money for tuition, before leaving school to join the military. After the war he moved to Roxbury and continued his studies at Harvard University and Boston University Law School. While still a student he founded a real estate agency, from which he retired circa 1992. 

In 1943, Bolling joined the segregated 92nd infantry division of the U.S. Army (also known as the "Buffalo Soldiers"), eventually rising to the rank of first lieutenant. He fought in German-occupied Italy, earning the Silver Star, Purple Heart, four Battle Stars, and the Combat Infantry Badge for "extraordinary leadership and valor under fire."

In 1961 he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he served six two-year terms. He represented the 11th Suffolk District (Ward 12) from 1961 to 1964 and the 7th Suffolk District from 1965 to 1968 and 1971 to 1974 (Wards 9 and 12 from 1961 to 1968 and Wards 8, 9, and 12 from 1971 to 1974). In 1982 he was elected to the Massachusetts Senate, where he represented the Second Suffolk District from 1983 to 1988.

Bolling authored over 200 legislative initiatives in the course of his career. In 1963, he proposed the original Racial Imbalance Act, a version of which was signed into law by Governor John Volpe in 1965 and which led to the desegregation of Boston's public schools. He was instrumental in establishing Boston's METCO program, and secured the initial funding for Roxbury Community College. He advocated for the creation of the Second Suffolk Senate District, which led to the election of Boston's first black state senator, Bill Owens, in 1974. 

In 1985 he sponsored the bill to redevelop the grounds of Boston State Hospital; dozens of mixed-income townhouses have since been built on the site, with many more planned. Bolling was an early advocate for gay rights, and chaired the Hispanic Commission, the state's first commission on issues affecting Latinos. He also chaired the senate's Public Service Committee. Widely recognized for his diplomatic skills, Bolling was chairman of the Special Legislative Committee on Foreign Trade and was hosted by heads of state around the world.

He was a member of the NAACP, the Urban League, the Black United Front, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans.

He married Thelma "Angela" Greene in 1943 and had 12 children. His first son, Royal L. Bolling Jr., served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives; his second son, Bruce Bolling, was Boston's first African-American City Council president.

Bolling's wife died of pancreatic cancer in 2002. A month later, Bolling died at his vacation home in Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, also of pancreatic cancer.

Senator Bolling Circle in Dorchester was named for Bolling in June 2006, at a dedication ceremony attended by former governor Michael Dukakis, former state senate president William M. Bulger, and many other Massachusetts politicians.

Marquette River

Marquette River is a tributary of Ashuapmushuan Lake, flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, into the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region
from Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada.

The Marquette River runs successively in the townships of Châteauford, Cramahé and Aigremont. The central part of the river flows through the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.

The Forest Road R0212 (East-West) intersects the upper portion of the Marquette River. The route 167 connecting Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Québec passes on the north-east shore of the Normandin River and the Northeast side of Ashuapmushuan Lake.

The surface of the Marquette River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice movement is generally from mid-November to mid-April.

This hydronym evokes the work of life of Jacques Marquette (Laon, France, 1637 - near Luddington, Michigan, 1675). He was a Jesuit missionary and explorer. He first studied Amerindian languages, then he devoted himself to various missions including the Outaouais; in 1671, he founded the mission of Saint-Ignace, among the Wendat (Hurons), on the north shore of the Michilimakinac Strait. In 1672, he met Louis Jolliet with whom he would reach the Mississippi River. He will explore this river to the present border of Arkansas and Louisiana. Anxious to found a mission with the Kaskaskias in the Illinois country, Father Marquette must give it up because of illness.

The toponym "Rivière Marquette" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec..

Lockdown (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)

"Lockdown" is the seventh episode of the second season of the American television police sitcom series "Brooklyn Nine-Nine". It is the 29th overall episode of the series and is written by co-executive producer Luke Del Tredici and directed by Linda Mendoza. It aired on Fox in the United States on November 16, 2014. It's the eight episode of the season to be produced but it's the seventh to be broadcast.

The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work in the precinct. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective in the precinct with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain is retiring and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Jake and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Jake is appointed Captain of the precinct when Holt and Terry leave for a charity event on Thanksgiving. However, the precinct goes on a lockdown when a mysterious powder spreads on the precinct with the HAZMAT unit working to determine if the precinct is toxic.

The episode was seen by an estimated 4.53 million household viewers and gained a 2.2/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised Samberg's performance in the episode but criticized the episode's focus on Jake while leaving most of the supporting cast sidelined.

Holt (Andre Braugher) and Terry (Terry Crews) leave for a charity event at Brighton Beach and put Jake (Andy Samberg) in charge of the precinct. Just when everyone is about to leave for Thanksgiving, Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) accidentally gets a package that contains a rare powder, forcing the precinct to go lockdown as other packages were sent to other precincts in the latest days. 

The incident forces Holt and Terry to skip the event and stop at Terry's house to monitor the situation. However, Terry's brother-in-law, Zeke (Jamal Duff), is in the house and is constantly bullying him. Zeke then begins to make amends with Terry when he believes that Terry has a terrible boss just like him. When Terry and Holt leave for the precinct, Terry asks Holt to act as a bad boss in front of him.

With the building in quarantine by the HAZMAT unit, Jake tries to calm everyone in an attempt to smooth the situation. However, when one of the people discover that the powder may be toxic, he reveals it to everyone, causing a mutiny. Using an advice from Amy (Melissa Fumero), Jake makes his position known to everyone, threatening to arrest everyone who challenges his authority just when the unit returns and proclaim that the powder isn't toxic just as Holt and Terry return.

In its original American broadcast, "Lockdown" was seen by an estimated 4.53 million household viewers and gained a 2.2/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a 13% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.99 million viewers with a 1.9/5 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 2.2 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating "Bob's Burgers" and "Family Guy" but behind "The Simpsons", fifth on its timeslot and fifth for the night, behind "Once Upon a Time", "The Simpsons", "The OT", and "NBC Sunday Night Football".

"Lockdown" received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. LaToya Ferguson of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a "C" grade and wrote, "To those viewers who have been finding season two of "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" to be weaker than season one, 'Lockdown' might actually be the perfect example of that dip. Throughout the entire episode, there's just constant shallow characterization — which is extremely uncharacteristic at this point in the series —that takes "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" to a dark place, quality-wise. That's because it takes it to "The Jake Peralta Show". Jake Peralta is a good character, and I've sung his praises in most (if not all) of these reviews, but when the show makes him the sole focus and only relies him, with everyone else as nothing more than his sounding boards, the downshift in quality is palpable."

Jackson McHenry of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote, "While 'Lockdown' all but forgets that history — Jake says he hates the holiday because 'the pilgrims were murderers and turkeys taste like napkins' — it does dig into Jake's surprisingly deep neurosis, and specifically his irrepressible desire to please everyone. In doing so, 'Lockdown' manages to put another spin on Andy Samberg's typically broad performance, making his eternally upbeat attitude seem manic and even desperate. It's not a perfect episode by any means, but it opens up a lot of possibilities for the character." Allie Pape from "Vulture" gave the show a 3 star rating out of 5 and wrote, "'Lockdown' lacked the absurdist zip of some of the other stuck-in-the-precinct episodes, like 'The Jimmy Jab Games' or the first Halloween episode. (The closest we got: Boyle doing the 'Single Ladies' dance, with two perps backing him up from behind the doors of the holding cell.) It still boasted plenty of good laugh lines, but I would have loved to see more advantage taken of the wild cast of characters stuck in there, who were more or less reduced to an angry mob despite getting some really awesome team nicknames."

Alan Sepinwall of "HitFix" wrote, "'Lockdown' felt like a throwback to those frustrating episodes from early in the first season where Jake would spend 80 percent of the episode ignoring obviously wise advice from Captain Holt, getting deeper and deeper into trouble until he finally listened. It's a pattern I'd hoped both Jake and the show had moved beyond, but here we got a variation on it, with Amy playing the role of Holt – even though, technically, the whole story was about Jake having to fill in for the captain on Thanksgiving. That Jake wants to be everybody's buddy, rather than the stern authority figure he's temporarily replacing, fits his character, but the whole A-story dragged as we waited for Jake to stop being such an idiot. With that many characters stuck in one location, there were some amusing moments in the margins (my favorite was Boyle doing the 'Single Ladies' dance with the hookers), but on a whole, this one didn't work." Andy Crump of "Paste" gave the episode a 6.8 and wrote, "'Lockdown' has a strong set-up and great jokes at its fingertips, but it doesn't have much direction, either. That leads to a whole lot of nothing, instead of growth among the show’s primary and secondary cast members; if anybody really learns anything here, it's Jake, put in charge over Amy for reasons that the script treats as perfunctory."

Drusilla Nixon

Drusilla Elizabeth Tandy Nixon (July 15, 1899 – May 10, 1990) was a community activist and music educator.

The daughter of Maud Grant and John Clifford Tandy, she was born Drusilla Elizabeth Tandy in Toledo, Ohio and was educated at Waite High School and the University of Toledo. After the University was forced to close due to the 1918 flu pandemic, she was hired by the American Missionary Association in Georgia and sent to Atlanta. By January 1920, she was working as a shipping clerk in Toledo. In November 1920, she moved to Knoxville, Tennessee. After her divorce from her first husband, she returned to Toledo. She served in a number of positions at Tuskegee Institute, including assistant to Emmett Jay Scott. She had moved to El Paso for eighteen months in October 1929 to help deal with an asthma condition; Lawrence Nixon, later her third husband, was her physician during this time. In 1935, she organized the Black Girl Reserves at the YWCA there. She was a member of the Phyllis Wheatley Club in El Paso for forty years, serving as club president at one time. She was the first black woman to serve on the board for the El Paso YWCA. She was also vice-president of the Church Women United, the choir director for St. James Myrtle United Methodist Church, co-chair of the El Paso Parks and Recreation Department, and a member of the El Paso Mental Health Board and the El Paso Council of Churches. In 1945, she became a charter member of the Southern Conference For Human Welfare in El Paso.

She was married three times: first to Webster L. Porter, an attorney and newspaper owner, in 1920; the couple divorced two years later after she gave birth to a daughter. She next married Ernest Ten Eyck Attwell; the couple, already separated, divorced in November 1935. She married Dr. Lawrence Aaron Nixon a few days later.

Nixon enjoyed teaching music to children; her students included congresswoman Barbara Lee.

She died in Albuquerque, New Mexico at the age of 90.

Nixon was posthumously named an honorary member of the El Paso Women's Hall of Fame.

As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, about long, wide and light reddish with prominent reddish-black bands. The lateral sepals are linear to lance-shaped, about long, wide, have a small gland on their tips and spread widely apart from each other. The petals are narrow egg-shaped, about long and wide with dark reddish bands. The labellum is elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long, wide with its edges densely covered with short, purplish hairs. There is a dark reddish-black callus in the centre of the labellum and extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from November to March.

"Genoplesium tectum" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". In 2002, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "Corunastylis tecta". The specific epithet ("tectum") is a Latin word meaning "covered", "concealed" or "secret", referring to the dense vegetation usually concealing this orchid.

The Cardwell midge orchid grows with dense sedges and grass in woodland and is only known from an area south of Cardwell.

Gordon Weisenborn

Gordon Weisenborn (March 20, 1923 – October 4, 1987) was an American director, producer, writer, and cinematographer. He won over 70 awards for films and productions. He was listed as one of the top 20 makers of specialized film by the Directors Guild.

Weisenborn was born in Chicago to Rudolph and Fritzie Weisenborn. Weisenborn's father was a Chicago Modernist painter. His mother, Fritizie, was an art critic. The Weisenborns had a good friendship with John Grierson who was known as the father of documentary. At the age of 19, Gordon Weisenborn was taken along to work with Grierson as his assistant in Canada. Under Grierson's wing, Weisenborn got to work at the National Film Board. Weisenborn attended the University of Chicago.

Weisenborn's films were highly influenced by his father's works. The young filmmaker had a significant friendship with John Barnes. Together they created several films, the most notable being "People Along the Mississippi" and "The Living City", which was nominated for an Academy award. "People Along the Mississippi" was considered the first educational film to present children of diverse races interacting with each other. Weisenborn and Barnes ended up splitting ways after a while of working together. The split directed Weisenborn towards the path of sponsored films as well as industrial ones. Weisenborn began teaching at Columbia College Chicago in the 1960s. In 1970, Weisenborn started his own production company, Gordon Weisenborn Productions, Inc. Under his company, Weisenborn continued to produce sponsored and educational films.

Weisenborn married Selma Revsin who occasionally participated in the making of some of his films including "Facing Up to Vandalism", "Water is Wet", "Girls are Better than Ever", etc. The pair did not have children.

Weisenborn died at Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, at 64 years of age. Before his death, Weisenborn gave the rights to his films to Jack Behrend, an industrial filmmaker who he was good friends with. The rights to both Weisenborn's films and Behrend's films are currently held by the Chicago Film Archives.

Inequalities in rural and inner city education

Inequalities in rural and inner city education are large scale systematic inequalities between differing spatial education systems. The study of these differences, especially within rural areas, is relatively new and distinct from the study of educational inequality which focuses on individual's within an educational system and has received a great deal of attention. There have been many systematic and social similarities between the rural and inner city school systems, as well as many differences. This information give insights into differing levels of academic achievement between these systems and those of sub-urban locations.

It has been found that students in rural and inner city school systems lag behind their peers in sub-urban school systems in academic achievement. Additionally, these students have a higher probability of dropping out of high school. These findings support the findings that low achieving schools are more likely to be located in disadvantaged areas and allow for research into causal factors.

The United States Government has created and utilizes many metrics to evaluate school and student educational performance. These performance metrics are then used to evaluate school systems as well as to implement competition between school systems, allow choice of schools, and to increase testing itself. Much of this standardized testing comes in the form of standardized tests which vary by region and state and may include:


Socioeconomic status is directly linked to a student's academic achievement but it complex as it is also indirectly linked to many other interacting systems which include; racial and ethnic background, grade level, and school location.

Racial and ethnic background is an important factor when looking at academic achievement. Surveys conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics determined that, on average, minority students trailed behind their white peers when it came to academic achievement. The research then indicated that the three main factors that contributed to this outcome were: "Minorities are more likely to live in low-income households or in single parent families; their parents are likely to have less education; and they often attend under-funded schools." These are all outcomes related to socioeconomic status. Some studies show that white students are less likely to be poor in any given year, have higher income-to-needs ratios and are more likely to live in affluent neighborhoods in comparison to black children.

There has been conflicting evidence regarding the effects that socioeconomic status has on academic achievement when it comes to grade level. In previous studies it was found that the correlation between academic achievement and socioeconomic status is diminished when regarding to grade level. They concluded that this was due in response to two factors. 1) Schools provide experiences that equalize the impact of family's socioeconomic status, therefore the longer a student stays in school, the less effect socioeconomic status will have. 2) A larger number of students from low socioeconomic status backgrounds drop out of school, making the correlation less significant. Though, there have been longitudinal studies that show that the gap between low and high socioeconomic students remains constant, even as a student gets older.

Because socioeconomic status is a direct factor of where a student will go to school, there has been a lot of research in regards to the relationship that socioeconomic status and academic achievement have. A review that the U.S. Department of Education did in 1996 showed that even when accounting for the socioeconomic status of a student, there was a significant difference in academic achievement between students from urban, rural, and suburban schools. Data from this review showed that students from affluent suburban schools academic achievement was significantly higher than those from "disadvantaged" inner-city and rural schools.

When looking at spatial inequalities, it is important to look from multiple points of view. Some factors that are commonly included are demographics, community atmosphere, school and family resources, dropout rates, spending per student, and family traits such as parental education. Currently, these, and other dimensions, are broadly grouped into two categories, "available resources" and "investment decisions". They each have their own effects, but also may cause and reinforce each other's existence.

In the same way some regions of the world have so called "brain drain", or the loss of wealthy, skilled, and educated individuals and their families to other countries through immigration, rural and inner city regions of the United States experience brain drain to sub-urban regions. It has been shown that people become more likely to leave rural areas as their education level increases and less likely as they increase in age. Urban inner city areas have been decentralizing since the 1950s, losing their human capital. This flight of human capital leaves only the poor and disadvantaged behind to contribute to school funding resulting in school systems that have very limited resources and financial difficulty.

The American public school system is one in which the amount of wealth in a school district shapes the quality of the school because schools are primarily funded by local property taxes. As the school system's funding decreases, they are forced to do more with less. This frequently results in decreased student faculty ratios and increased class sizes. Many schools are also forced to cut funding for the arts and enrichment programs which may be vital to academic success. Additionally, with decreased budgets, access to specialty and advanced classes for students who show high potential frequently decreases. A less obvious consequence of financial difficulty is difficulty in attracting new teachers and staff, especially those who are experienced.

It has been shown that the socioeconomic status of the family has a large correlation with both the academic achievement and attainment of the student. "The income defecate for inner city students is approximately $14,000 per year and $10,000 per year for the families of those living in the respective areas compared to the average income of families in sub-urban areas." Though, even within rural areas, there are differences in education and job choisis respective to demographics.

More well off sub-urban families can afford to spend money on their children's education in forms such as: private school, private tutoring, home lessons, and increased access to educational materials such as computers, books, educational toys, shows, and literature.

Sub-urban families are also frequently able to provide larger amounts of social capital to their kids, such as increased use of "proper English", exposure to plays and museums, and familiarity with music, dance, and other such programs. Even more, inner city students are more likely to come from single parent homes and rural students are more likely to have siblings than their sub-urban peers decreasing the amount of investment per child their families are able to afford. This notion is called "resource dilution" which posits that families have finite levels of resources, such as time, energy and money. When sibship (amount of siblings) increases, resources for each child becomes diluted.

Even if families and schools have the same resources available to them, that doesn't mean they will use them in the same way, or to the same extent. Often, people need proof that there is a connection between investing resources and academic success before they do it. Investment decisions are a function of both resources available and political processes, in regards to distribution of public funds.

The investment a family puts into their child's education is largely reflective of the value the parent puts on education. The value placed on education is largely a combination of the parent's education level and the visual returns on education in the community the family lives in.

Sub-urban families tend to have parents with a much larger amount of education than families in rural and inner city locations. This allows sub-urban parents to have personal experience with returns on education as well as familiarity with educational systems and processes. In addition, parents can invest and transmit their own cultural capital to their children by taking them to museums, enrolling them in extra-curriculars or even having educational items in the house. In contrast, parents from rural and urban areas tend to have less education and little personal experience with its returns. The areas they live in also put very little value on education and reduce the incentive to gain it. This leads to families that could afford to invest greater resources in their children's education not to.

In the same way that a region or community that places little value on education may decrease a parent's willingness to invest in the education of their children, that community can reduce a school's willingness to allocate funding to provide advanced and in depth educational opportunities for its students. School boards tend to invest resources in response to the demands of the community, and their communities values have been changed due to the "brain drain" mentioned previously.

The Kids in the Shoe is a 1935 short animated film produced by Max Fleischer. It is a humorous retelling of the classic nursery rhyme.

In the shoe, the woman and her children are shown on their daily lives. Curiously enough, all of the children look identical with the exception of the youngest child, whom the woman tends to personally. It is shown that the children are rebellious by nature, purposefully giving their meals to the cat and avoiding their combing and teeth brushing.

After the children are sent to sleep, they begin a rowdy song and the situation becomes happy but highly chaotic. The woman later wakes up and threatens them to feed them castor oil if they don't go to sleep, which they happily comply with.

The woman reveals that the castor oil was simply apple cider which she energetically drinks.

<doc id="56563697" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56563697" title="Swahili grammar">
Swahili grammar

Swahili grammar is typical for Bantu languages, bearing all the hallmarks of this language family. These include agglutinativity, a rich array of noun classes, extensive inflection for person (both subject and object), tense, aspect and mood, and generally a subject–verb–object word order.

Swahili may be described in several ways depending on the aspect being considered.

Swahili nouns can be are grouped into noun classes based on the prefix they have, with each class having a prescribed number. For example, the nouns "wasichana" "girls" and "wasimamizi" "overseers" belong to class 2, characterised by the prefix "wa-", whereas "kifuniko" "lid, cover" and "kisukari" "diabetes" belong to class 7, characterised by the prefix "ki-". The classes 5, 9 and 10 are frequently without any prefix. The numbers are based on the classes reconstructed for Proto-Bantu, and have corresponding classes in the other Bantu languages which can be identified by the same system of numbers. Therefore, classes that are missing in Swahili create a gap in the numbering, as is the case with classes above 18 as well as classes 12, 13, which are absent in standard Swahili (although do frequently occur in non-standard varieties).

The following noun classes exist:


Every class up to 11 can be regarded as inherently singular or plural. Odd-numbered classes are singular, even-numbered classes are plural. The plural of a noun is normally formed by switching it to the next higher class. Thus, the plural of class 1 "mtu" "person" is class 2 "watu" "people". For class 11 nouns, the plural is in class 10. Class 14 usually has no plural at all, but in rare instances class 6 is used to form a plural for these nouns, for example "ugonjwa" "sickness, disease", "magonjwa" "diseases". Class 6 also contains a lot of nouns for liquids, such as "maji" "water", and other nouns derived from verbs such as "mazungumzo" "conversation(s)". Aside from these, there are some nouns in other classes that do not change class to indicate number, such as "mchana" "afternoon(s)", "daytime" (class 3), "vita" "war(s)" (class 8), "usiku" "night(s)" (class 14), and these can be shown as singular or plural only by surrounding context.

In terms of meaning, groups of similar nouns tend to belong to similar noun classes. For example, nouns for people, including agent nouns, are commonly in classes 1/2, while animals are often in classes 9/10. Nouns describing plants are in class 3/4 and if they produce fruit, it will probably be in class 5/6. Abstract nouns are often in class 14, loanwords in classes 9/10 and 5/6. Many nouns for liquids are in class 6. Infinitives/gerunds of verbs are in class 15. Diminutives as well as the words for many man-made tools and languages are in class 7/8. These are only generalisations and there are exceptions in most classes.

The class of the noun determines the forms of other parts of speech that relate to it, such as verbs, adjectives, etc. This process is called agreement or concord. These other parts of speech receive their own concordant prefixes (termed "concords" for short), generally matching in class with the noun, though the prefixes themselves are not always the same. In the examples below, the left and right sides of the table show sentences with a singular and then plural subject respectively.

Animate nouns (i.e. those referring to people or animals) which are not in classes 1/2 generally take the agreement prefixes (concords) from classes 1/2 as if they did belong to it.

Animacy agreements can often distinguish different meanings of the same noun, such as "ndege", which means "bird(s)" when animate and "aeroplane(s)" when inanimate.

Animate nouns in classes 9/10 may exhibit a slight abberation from this pattern. The genitive pronominal forms "-angu", "-ako", "-ake", "-etu", "-enu" and "-ao" are frequently inflected with a group of nouns referring to close human relationships with their appropriate class 9/10 concords, regardless of the fact that they are animate (giving "yangu", "yako", "yetu" etc. in singular and "zangu", "zako", "zetu" etc. in plural). For some speakers, the same rule applies to the simple genitive preposition "-a" (giving "ya" in singular and "za" in plural), however for most speakers "wa" is used for all animate nouns regardless of number or class. Other parts of speech are unaffected by this exception.

Nouns which follow this pattern of agreement include "mama" "mother(s)", "baba" "father(s)", "ndugu" "sibling(s)/relative(s)", "kaka" "(elder) brother(s)", "dada" "(elder) sister(s)", "nyanya" "grandmother(s)", "bibi" "grandmother(s)", "babu" "grandfather(s)", "shangazi" "paternal aunt(s)", "shemeji" "sister(s)/brother(s)-in-law", "wifi" "sister(s)-in-law", "jamaa" "relative(s)", "rafiki" "friend(s)", "shoga" "female friend of a woman", "jirani" "neighbour" and "adui" "enemy". 

Nouns of this group, such as "rafiki" "friend", may optionally take a plural prefix "ma-" as though belonging to class 5/6, although their concords remain the same mix of class 1/2 and 9/10.

In addition, animals of classes 9/10 generally take class 1 agreement throughout the singular, but may take 10 agreement on pronominal genitive words in the plural.

Another departure from the rule of animate nouns taking concords in classes 1/2 occurs on occasion with diminutives and augmentatives, whereby using concords of the class the noun belongs to (5/6 for augmentatives, 7/8 for diminutives) emphasises the dimunition or augmentation.

A locative noun is a derived noun that indicate a location associated with the base noun from which it is derived. The change in meaning can translate to a variety of English prepositions indicating location, such as "in", "at", "on", "to" or "from", and is thus quite general in meaning, with the exact meaning of the phrase generally being determined by the verb.

The Arabic loan noun "mahali" "place" (and its variations: "pahali", "mahala" and "pahala") is the only noun which inherently belongs to the locative class. Other nouns can be made locative by adding the suffix "-ni" to the end, although this is not available for proper nouns referring to places, any animate nouns, recent loanwords and some other arbitrary nouns.

Because locative nouns constitute three classes of their own, they cannot take the usual concords of the noun they have been derived from. The concords themselves show in which one of the locative classes the noun is being used. Class 16 is marked by concords based on "pa-" and indicates specific location. Class 17, with concords based on "ku-" indicates a more general location. Class 18 has concords based on "mu-" and indicates internal location.


The equivalent of compound words are usually formed using the genitive construction such as "mpira wa kikapu" "basketball" (literally ""ball of basket""). This is similar to the compounding process found in many languages such as French "fin de semaine" "weekend" (literally ""end of week"").

There are also many compounds which do not use the genitive preposition "-a". In these cases, two (or more) nouns are simply placed side by side.

The word order is the reverse of most compounds in English, with the head always preceding the modifiers in Swahili; in other words, the first noun describes "what" it is, and any subsequent noun narrows or specifies that description. For example, the class 9/10 noun "punda" "donkey(s)" is followed by the class 4 noun "milia" "stripes" to mean "zebra". Whereas in English, a hypothetical equivalent compound would place the noun for the stripes first and also require the singular: "stripe-donkey", the word for "donkey" appears first in Swahili.

There is a good deal of variation among different authors as to whether the nouns are written together, hyphenated or separated and thus the word for "zebra(s)" may appear as any of "pundamilia", "punda-milia" or "punda milia".

A few common compound words have irregular plural forms because number marking occurs on both elements. The word mwanamke" "woman" becomes wanawake" "women" in plural. Similarly, mwanamume" "man" becomes wanaume" "men" in plural, although the singular form "mwanaume" is also common. These two nouns are formed from the word "mwana" "son, daughter", which is commonly used in compounds to essentially mean "person", followed by the words "mke" "wife" (plural: "wake") and "mume" "husband" (plural: "waume") respectively.

Pronouns behave in many ways like nouns, having both plural and singular forms, being present in the full range of noun classes but no inflection for case, meaning that, for instance, there is no difference between "we" and "us", which are both "sisi".

Personal pronouns occur in two forms: an independent form, which is used as a word alone, and a combining stem, which is used when combined with words such as "na" "with, and" and "ndi-" "it is". The independent form consists, in all cases except for "wao", of a reduplication of a syllable. "Nyinyi", however, may alternatively be dissimilated to "ninyi". These pronouns also have a separate genitive (possessive) stem, which is the combining stem that is used when a genitive prefix is added.

Note that the sex/gender of referents is not distinguished, with "yeye" capable of meaning either "he" or "she". These pronouns are, however, restricted to use with animate referents, i.e. people or animals, so it does not generally mean "it". The genitive form "-ake" has no such restriction and may mean "his", "hers" or "its" depending on context.

Swahili is a pro-drop language. As the verb usually already includes prefixes to indicate the subject and object, personal pronouns aren't strictly needed, and are mostly used for emphasis. The exceptions to this include cases when the copula "ni" (or its negative counterpart "si") is used, as well as with the habitual form of the verb, which lacks subject prefixes.

In informal speech, when pronouns are unstressed, they may appear in a reduced form, such as "mi" or "mie" for "mimi". This mainly occurs when the pronoun is not added only for emphasis, but is needed (e.g. "mi ni" "I am", informally), and this also frequently occurs where the first person singular subject prefix "ni-" is dropped in casual speech before "-na-". For example, standard "(mimi) ninajua" "I know" often occurs as ("mi) najua" in spoken Swahili.

Determiners in Swahili are capable of being used adjectivally (with a noun) or pronominally (standing in for an absent noun). The inflection of Swahili determiners resembles that of verbs.

There are no articles in Swahili. A word such as "kitabu" "book" may be taken to mean either "the book" or "a book" depending on context. If the distinction must be made demonstratives or adjectives may be used to provide various shades of meaning such as "kitabu hicho" "that (aforementioned) book", "kitabu kimoja" "one book", "kitabu fulani" "some (particular) book", "kitabu chochote" "any book (at all)".

The demonstratives in Swahili may be used either as adjectives, with a noun, or as pronouns, standing alone. They occur in three types:

There is one pronoun of each type for each noun class. There is also a combining form that appears suffixed on certain other words such as "na" and "ndi-". This combining form is identical to the relative marker for each class.

The demonstratives may stand alone, as true pronouns, but may also be used in combination with a noun, much like "this" and "that" in English. The demonstrative generally follows the noun but it can also precede. Before a noun, it often takes on a slightly more article-like role.

The words "-ote" "all", "-o-ote" "any", "-pi" "which" and "-enyewe" "-self", "-selves""," appear with prefixes following the verbal inflection pattern. In older texts, "-o-ote" was frequently written as two words (eg. "ye yote", "vyo vyote") however it is now more frequently written together. For the sake of comparison, the following table also includes the genitive and ornative prepositions "-a" and "-enye" as well as the verbal subject prefixes for each class. Note that class 1 has the most irregularity and diversity of form.


The term "adjective", as applied to Swahili and most other Bantu languages, usually applies only to a rather restricted set of words. However, in the wider sense, it can refer to any word that modifies a noun. The wider sense is used here. Adjectives in the stricter Bantu sense are referred to as "true adjectives" in this article. True adjectives in Swahili may be divided into two categories: "inflecting adjectives", which take a prefix indicating the noun class of their referent, and "invariable adjectives", which do not take a prefix.

All adjectives have one thing in common: they all follow the noun they modify, and, aside from the plain adjectives, require some kind of prefix whose class matches the preceding noun. The different types of adjectives reflect the different prefixes that are used:

Inflecting adjectives are words which describe a noun or pronoun and take the following prefixes, which are very similar to the prefixes found on nouns. This distinguishes them from determiners, which take prefixes similar to those on verbs. The most notable departure from the nominal inflection pattern among inflecting adjectives is the replacement of the nominal "u-" prefix in class 11 (and generally also 14) with the adjectival "m-" prefix. The locative classes also carry prefixes, unlike the locative nouns they refer to.

Most inflecting adjectives have stems beginning with a consonant. Of those that begin with a vowel, almost all of these have stems that begin with either "e" (for example, "-ekundu" "red") or "i" (eg. "-ingi" "many, much"). A very small minority of adjectives begin with other vowels, but these happen to refer only to animate referents and thus only have forms in classes 1 and 2, for example: "-ovu" "evil, wicked", which is mwovu" in class 1 and waovu" in class 2.
The adjective "-ingine" "other", is sometimes given inflections prefixes of the type found with determiners, following a verbal rather than a nominal pattern. Most notably, the forms lingine in class six, ingine or yingine in class 9 and zinginein class 10 may be heard. Some speakers also use an e in these classes:" jengine, lengine, nyengine, yengineand" zenginesometimes occurring. These forms are regarded as non-standard, although they may be commonly heard. The standard forms of each are jingine for class 6 and nyingine for classes 9 and 10.

The numerals "-moja" "one", "-wili" "two", "-tatu" "three", "-nne" "four", "-tano" "five" and "-nane" "eight", as well as all numbers that end with these words, take prefixes as inflecting adjectives do. 

Invariable adjectives are mostly loanwords from Arabic, such as "safi" "clean", "ghali" "expensive", although loanwords from other languages are also present, such as "faini", from English "fine". Nouns placed as modifiers after other nouns may also be regarded as invariable adjectives, such as "msichana kiziwi" "Deaf girl", which has a class 1 prefix "m-" and a class 7 prefix "ki-". Numbers loaned from Arabic: "sita" "six", "saba" "seven" and "tisa" "nine", "ishirini" "twenty", etc., as well as the native Bantu number "kumi" "ten", function as invariable adjectives. The interrogative adjective "gani" "what kind of" or, colloquially, "which" is also invariable.

Relatives are verbs used as adjectives by being relativised using a relative prefix (or suffix) which agrees with the noun's class.
These are frequently used in Swahili and make up for the relative paucity of "true adjectives". For example, there are no true adjectives equivalent to the English adjectives "open" and "dead", however the verbs "kufa" "to die" and "kufunguliwa" "to be opened", when relativised, convey these meanings. Examples of this in use:

Another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the genitive construction using the genitive preposition "-a". The prefixes that this preposition takes are outlined here.

In many cases, the noun introduced in an genitive adjective phrase receives an additional "ki-" prefix, such as "-a kimataifa" "international" (from "mataifa" "nations") and "-a kihistoria" "historic" (from "historia" "history").

Yet another construction which makes up for the paucity of true adjectives in Swahili is the ornative construction using "-enye". Some examples of adjectival phrases with "-enye" include "-enye nguvu" "strong" (with strength), "-enye nywele fupi" "short-haired" (having short hair), and "-enye senta moja" "concentric" (having one centre). The forms of "-enye" as well as some more examples of use can be seen here.

Like nouns, verbs are formed by adding prefixes to a basic stem. However, unlike the prefixes of nouns, verbal prefixes are not a fixed part of the verb, but indicate subject, object, tense, aspect, mood and other inflectional categories. Normally, verbs are cited in dictionaries in the stem form, often with a hyphen to indicate that prefixes are added, such as "-sema" "say", "-andika" "to write", "-la" "to eat". It is also possible to use the infinitive/gerund form which begins with "ku-" or, for a couple of verbs only, "kw-", such as "kusema" "to say", "kuandika" "to write", "kula" "to eat".

Prefixes are always attached in a fixed order; the object prefix always comes last, immediately before the verb stem, while the subject prefix comes before the object prefix. Most of the time, a tense, aspect, mood or polarity prefix may intervene between the subject and object prefix, or be placed before the subject prefix. A common mnemonic used by learners of Swahili for the order of parts of a verb is STROVE.


In learner materials, all types of prefixes other than the subject prefixes are frequently, erroneously referred to as infixes. It should, however, be noted that the term "infix", as used by linguists, refers only to a morpheme (≈ part of a word) that is inserted "within" another morpheme, not simply in between other morphemes within a word. Under the strict definition of the word, Swahili does not make use of infixes.

Here is an example of a verb with all slots filled:

<nowiki>*</nowiki> This "(a)" appears when this is the final element of the word and is otherwise dropped.

Most of the time, verbs will not have all slots filled. Here are some other examples.

There are a number of derivational suffixes (frequently termed 'extensions') which can be added to the end of verbs to derive new meanings, some of which have been shown above.

There are three basic inflection groups which differ only very slightly from one another:
Common verbs are the largest group of verbs in Swahili. In their infinitive form, they consist of three or more syllables and end with "-a". All verbs of native Bantu origin end with "-a", including the short verbs mentioned below. Some examples of common verbs are "kuanguka" "to fall", "kufanya" "to do, to make", "kuona" "to see", "kuwaza" "to think", "kusaidia" "to help". The final "-a" is replaced with another vowel in certain grammatical contexts, becoming "-i" in the present negative, and "-e" in the subjunctive and imperative forms involving an object prefix. The plural address marker "-ni" also triggers this final "-a" to become "-e."

Short verbs are those which, in their infinitive form, consist of only two syllables, such as "kula" "to eat", "kunywa" "to drink", "kuja" "to come", "kupa" "to give". The verbs "kwenda" "to go" and "kwisha" "to finish" may belong to this group, although it is also common for these verbs to be conjugated as common verbs (as "kuenda" and "kuisha"). Because the stems of most of these verbs, once the infinitive prefix "ku-" is removed, are monosyllabic, these are frequently termed monosyllabic verbs, however this is problematic as the final "-a" of Bantu verbs is often not considered to be part of the root (meaning that roots of many of these verbs consists of only a single consonant or consonant cluster, such as "-p-" "give"). Furthermore, when the final "-a" is considered part of the stem, this excludes "-enda" and "-isha", which generally conjugate in a similar way to the other short verbs. The short verbs are all native Bantu verbs ending in "-a" and undergo the same "-i" and "-e" alterations as the common verbs. Additionally, they are characterised by the insertion (or retention) of the syllable "-ku-" in certain verb forms. This intrusive "-ku-" (which may be glossed as for "extension") prevents the penultimate stress from falling on certain TAM prefixes (-"na-", "-me-", "-li-", "-ta-", "-sha-", "-nge-", "-ngeli-") and relative prefixes, which are inherently unable be stressed. This "-ku-" disappears in verb forms where the stress is allowed to fall on a subject or object prefix, or on certain other TAM prefixes ("-a-", "hu-", "-ki-", "-ka-", "-ku-", "-si-"). (The TAM prefix "-ja-" can be regarded as belonging to either group, depending on the speaker.) Because the initial stem vowel of "-enda" and "-isha" takes the stress, this explanation does not sufficiently fit, however it should suffice to say that the distribution of their "-kw-" extension, among speakers who use it, is identical to that of the "-ku-" extension in other short verbs.

The Loan verbs, also frequently called "Arabic" verbs, are those which do not end in "-a" in the infinitive. Not all verbs, from Arabic are in this group, however, such as "kusaidia", which is an Arabic loan which happens to end in "-a" and is thus declined as a common verb. Likewise, not all Loan verbs come from Arabic, such as "kukisi" "to kiss" and "kuripoti" "to report", which are from English. What these verbs share in common is that they are all loan-words and none of them end in "-a". The consequence of this is that they do not take the suffixes "-e" and "-i" that the verbs ending in "-a" do, which occasionally results in ambiguity, such as in "si-ku-sahau-Ø" which could either mean "I did not forget" (NEG.1S-NEG.PST-forget-Ø) or "I do not forget you" (NEG.1s-2s-forget-PRES.NEG).

Both the subject and, when applicable, the object of the verb are indicated by "prefixes" or "concords" attached to the verb stem. Swahili is a pro-drop language: explicit personal pronouns are only used for emphasis, or with verb forms that do not indicate subject or object. When a noun is used as the subject or object, then the concord must match its class. Animate nouns (referring to a person or animal) are an exception and these occur with concords of the noun classes 1 (singular) or 2 (plural). The subject concord must always be present, except in the infinitive, habitual and imperative forms. The object concord is generally optional; although some sources maintain that it must always be used with animate objects, this appears not to be the case as counter-examples are commonplace. Whether it is used or not appears to have to do with animacy, specificity and definiteness as well as pragmatic considerations of emphasis.

Six different forms of verbal concord exist.

For the subject, there are both negative and positive forms, while there are only positive forms for objects. The negative subject concords are formed by prefixing the syllable "ha-" to the beginning, except for the irregular forms "si-" (instead of "*hani-"), "hu-" (instead of "*hau-") and "ha-" (instead of "*haa-") which are used, respectively, for first, second and third person singular animate subjects.

Additionally, in (the third person singular of) noun class 1, the prefix "yu-" is used instead of "a-" as the subject of a locative copula. (This "yu-" can also be seen in the demonstratives.) The negative form of "yu-" is formed regularly, by appending the prefix "ha-".

Before the present 'indefinite' marker "-a-", subject concords are shortened to just a consonant or consonant cluster in a similar manner to the prefix which occur on the genitive preposition "-a".

Object concords are generally the same as the positive subject concord, although there are a few exceptions for instances involving animate referents; 2nd person singular and plural, as well as 3rd person singular (class 1) all have different forms for subject and object concord.

Examples:

Because the 2nd person plural object prefix "-wa-" is the same as the object prefix for class 2 (3rd person plural object), a word such as "ninawaona" may ambiguously mean "I see you all" or "I see them." These two possibilities may be disambiguated by placing the pronoun after the verb: "ninawaona ninyi / wao. Very frequently, however, the suffix "-eni" is appended to the verb to indicate that the second person plural is meant: "ninawaoneni "I see you all." This suffix causes the final "a" of Bantu verbs to shift to "e". On loan verbs, this suffix is simply "-ni". Some speakers use the prefix "-ku-" (otherwise indicating 2nd person singular) with the suffix "-(e)ni", as in "ninakuoneni" "I see you all."

The reflexive prefix only occurs as an object, and refers back to the subject of the sentence. It is equivalent to English forms like "myself", "yourself", "himself" and so on.

The infinitive is a verbal noun, and belongs to class 15, which is reserved specifically for infinitives. It is marked by the prefix ku-. It may occur in the same contexts as other nouns and may, occasionally, even be derived into the locative classes by means of attaching the suffix "-ni", as in "kuangukani" "in falling" (i.e. "while falling"). It corresponds to the English infinitive or gerund. Infinitives cannot take subject, relative or TAM prefixes, but they may take object prefixes.

The negative infinitive is derived from the verb "kutoa" "to subtract", "to not do", although it is rarely encountered in its full form for this use. The additional "-ku-" in brackets is the infinitive marker of the original verb, although it may be omitted as long as stress rules allow.

For the sake of simplicity, the following verb forms may be referred to as "tenses" as they often are in learner materials, but it should be remembered that many of these are not grammatical tenses in the technical sense but may instead be aspects or moods. All together, Tense, Aspect and Mood may be abbreviated as TAM.

The following table shows a summary of TAM forms which will be discussed in further depth below. Brackets indicate optional elements and slashes indicate alternative elements of which either (but not both) may fill the same slot in the verb. The column labelled 'final vowel' is only relevant for "short" and "common verbs", with "loan verbs" remaining invariable here with the exception of the "-ni" suffix added to indicate 2nd person plural address. In any TAM form, when the object is 2nd person plural, this "-(e)ni" prefix may also occur, but this is not shown in this table. 
<nowiki>*</nowiki> Note that the 'indefinite' present "-a-" causes the form of the subject marker to change as outlined above. 

The imperative mood is used to issue direct commands. It can occur either alone or with an object prefix. The presence of an object prefix (including the reflexive "ji-") causes the final "-a" of Bantu verbs to become "-e". Note that the "ji-" prefix of reflexive verbs is an object prefix, meaning, for example, that the imperative of "-jifunza" "to learn" is "jifunze" "learn!" and not "*jifunza".

The plural form, with the suffix "-ni", is used when addressing multiple people.

The following verbs have irregular imperatives, regular forms may be heard, particularly by non-native speakers and particularly in Kenya, and regular forms may be interpreted as less polite:
The verb "-acha" may informally be given the imperative form wacha (pl. wacheni).

Additionally, the verb "kuwa" "to be" has an irregular imperative form: iwe (pl. iweni), although this is rarely used and more frequently replaced by a regular imperative form kuwa (pl. kuweni) or used in the subjunctive ("polite imperative") form: uwe (pl. mwe).

There is no actual negative imperative form. The equivalent is achieved with the negative subjunctive. The formation of this is outlined below, but for the sake of completeness the negative equivalents of the above examples are given here.

There are two present tenses in Swahili. These are sometimes termed the "definite present" (with -na-) and the "indefinite present" (with -a-). In modern, standard Swahili, however, there is no great difference in meaning between these two forms as the "indefinite present" is more or less obsolete and rarely used other than its frequent appearance in media headlines. A distinction between these two forms is not made in the negative, with both forms being negated the same way.

<nowiki>*</nowiki> Although rarely used, the "indefinite present" adds a small complication to the presentation of Swahili grammar as the -a- marking the tense causes the subject concords to undergo reduction in the same manner as the prefixes of the genitive preposition "-a". This is outlined above.

In informal Swahili, it is very common for the first person singular concord "ni-" to collapse into the -na- of the definite present tense marker and become inaudible (and unwritten). The distinction between the "definite" and "indefinite" present tense forms appears to vanish in the first person as both begin with a "na-", however short verbs retain their "-ku-" extension in the "-na-" tense and lose it in the "-a-" tense, allowing this distinction to still be felt, such as in "(ni)nakula" "I eat", in the "-na-" present tense, versus "nala" "I eat", in the "-a-" present tense.

The habitual verb form is unusual in that it does not allow subject prefixes to appear on it. The prefix hu- is added to the beginning of the verb and short verbs do not need their "-ku-" extension.
The habitual indicates repeated, habitual occurrence of an action (habitual aspect) or something occurring as a timeless general rule (gnomic aspect). Because subject prefixes are absent, personal pronouns are very frequently used to indicate the subject.

The habitual aspect with "hu-" is often replaced by the present with "-na-" in everyday use, the "sisi hunywa" of the above example then being replaced with "tunakunywa." Some speakers instead use the non-standard habitual suffix -ga or -nga which has entered Swahili from other Bantu languages spoken in East Africa, giving "tunakunywaga" or "tunakunywanga". The habitual aspect with "hu-" is, however, very commonly used in proverbs dealing with eternal truisms.

The past tense is used in Swahili to talk about actions or states in the past, whether in the near or the distant past. It is formed with the prefix "-li-". Its negative equivalent is formed with the negative subject prefix plus "-ku-". The positive tense marker "-li-" cannot take stress and triggers the use of the extension "-ku-" (or "-kw-") where necessary. The negative tense marker "-ku-" can take stress, meaning that an additional "-ku-" extension is not needed.

The perfect indicates an action or situation which occurred in the past, similarly to the past tense, however the focus of the utterance is on the relevance of this past action to the present moment. For example, the word "nimepika" "I have cooked" describes a past action with present relevance (i.e. the food is ready now) whereas "nilipika" "I cooked" describes a past action with no implication of any relevance to the present (the food may have been eaten long ago, or not).

The perfect is formed in the positive with the prefix -me-. The negative is formed with the negative subject prefix plus -ja-. As with the present and past tenses, the positive present marker -me- cannot take the word stress and triggers the appearance of the "-ku-" extension in short verbs, but the negative marker -ja- is able to be stressed. Some speakers may use the extension "-ku-" with -ja-.

Some sources describe the -ja- form as containing more of an implication of "not yet" than a simple negation of the "-me"- form, however the word "bado" "still", "not yet" may be used to indicate this explicitly where necessary.

Inchoative verbs, such as "kuchoka" "to get tired", which describe the entering of a state, are used in the perfect to indicate "being" in the state in question. Compare for example: "ninachoka" "I am becoming tired"; "nimechoka" "I have become tired", i.e. "I am tired." For more information and examples, see the section on inchoative verbs below.

Some speakers may replace the sequence of prefixes a-me- with ka- with more or less the same meaning. This may derive from the consecutive tense marker.

The anterior marker -sha- (or sometimes -kwisha-) is a relatively new TAM marker that derives diachronically from the verb kwisha "to finish, to run out". It is most commonly (and perhaps least controversially) used directly after the perfect marker -me-. It often imparts the meaning of "already", emphasising the completeness of the action.
The anterior marker -sha- is also used with other TAM markers, simply sitting after them within the TAM slot. It may also on occasion be used on its own, with a function more or less equivalent to the perfect "-me-". These uses may not be regarded as standard Swahili. It is frequently used with the situational marker "-ki-" where it indicates a situation in which the action has been completed.

The future tense is formed in Swahili with the prefix -ta-. The negative form is indicated simply by using the negative subject prefix, with -ta- being used here as well. A number of speakers, however, use -to- in the negative future. This may be derived by analogy from the "-to-" of the negative infinitive, and may also disambiguate between positive and negative where the only difference otherwise would be an "h-" at the beginning of the negative word. For example "atakuja" "s/he will come" vs. "hatakuja" "s/he will not come" (or "hatokuja"). Because second language speakers in many areas have trouble with pronouncing and distinguishing /h/, the optional change from -ta- to -to- in the negative can provide a failsafe indication when a negative meaning is intended.

-Ta- (and likewise -to-) cannot take the word stress whether in positive or negative and thus causes the appearance of the "-ku-" extension in short verbs.

The subjunctive (sometimes referred to as an optative) expresses hypothetical situations, wishes and requests. It is also used as a complement to certain auxiliary verbs and conjunctions. The subjunctive is indicated by the lack of any Tense-Aspect-Mood prefix and the change of the final "-a", where present, to "-e"-. The so-called "Arabic verbs" do not undergo this change and the subjunctive form is made simply by omitting any tense marker. The negative subjunctive is indicated by adding the syllable "-si-" into the tense slot, with the positive subject prefix being used rather than the negative.

The subjunctive is frequently used following the equivalents of modal verbs, verbs indicating wishes, suggestions, recommendations and other constructions.

An equivalent of "must" or "have to" is formed with "ni lazima" "it is necessary", or simply "lazima" "necessarily" followed by the subjunctive. 
The subjunctive may be used on its own with a second person subject as a more polite alternative to an imperative. As there is no negative imperative, forms beginning with "usi-" and "msi-" may also be interpreted as such.
The situational, simultaneous or conditional tense is formed with the TAM prefix -ki-. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension "-ku-" does not appear with short verbs in the situational verb form.

There is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however, in conditional sentences, the relative verb form using -sipo- is quite close in meaning to a negative equivalent of -ki- and it will be given here as it may prove helpful. Note that the "-ku-" extension "does" appear with "-sipo-" as the "-po-", like all relative syllables, is unable to be stressed. 

The situational verb form is used to indicate a simultaneous action or situation of subordinate importance that provides the temporal or contextual background for the main verb in the sentence. It is somewhat equivalent to the English conjunctions "if" and "when", but it also forms the equivalent of adverbial participle clauses. If needed for clarity or emphasis, a word meaning if, such as "kama", "ikiwa" or "endapo" may be added to the beginning of the clause (which allows the speaker to choose a different TAM marker). The word "ikiwa" is itself the situational form of the verb "-wa" "to be", with the class 9 subject prefix "i-", literally meaning on its own essentially "if it is".

The situational may appear in compound progressive tenses.
The consecutive or narrative tense is formed with the TAM prefix -ka-. This prefix may take stress and thus the extension "-ku-" does not appear with short verbs in this form.
The consecutive tense is mainly used with the past tense -li- in narrating a sequence of events whereby "-li-" is used for the first verb and "-ka-" for subsequent verbs. It roughly carries the meaning "and then" and makes the use of "na" "and" or "halafu" / "kisha" "then" essentially redundant. Where context is clearly past, a narrative may also be begun with "-ka-".
There is, strictly speaking, no negative form of the situational, however the negative subjunctive may occasionally be used for this purpose.
The consecutive marker -ka- may combine with the final -e of the subjunctive mood to form the expeditous.

The expeditous verb form is essentially the same as the subjunctive in meaning except with the added meaning of "and" or "then" introduced by the consecutive marker -ka-.

The word "akawe" in the above sentence could also be replaced with "ili awe" "in order that he be" or simply the subjunctive "awe" "that he be" (or ""(for him) to be"" in more natural contemporary English), but the "-ka-" added to this word emphasises his becoming an ambassador immediately following his being dispatched.

The expeditous verb form is frequently used with imperatives (and "polite imperatives" in the subjunctive), again indicating roughly "and then".

The subject prefix may be dropped when used with the imperative.
There are two irrealis verb forms, one which may be called "present irrealis" (marked by -nge-) and one which may be called "past irrealis" (marked by -ngali-). The standard means of forming the negative is to use "-si-" in the TAM slot, forming "-singe-" and "-singali"-. Some speakers, however, particularly in speech influenced by southern dialects, negate the irrealis verb forms instead by using the negative subject concords.

Both the irrealis forms are used to discuss hypothetical situations, generally within conditional sentences. Both the protasis (if-clause) and apodosis (then-clause) may have an identical structure with the protasis appearing first. In order to disambiguate or emphasise, such as if the clauses are in the reverse order, a word for "if" ("kama", "ikiwa", "endapo") may precede the protasis. 

In the usage of many speakers, the distinction between the present and past irrealis forms is somewhat blurred so that the final example above may commonly be spoken as ""(Kama) ningejua hiyo, nisingekuja hapa"." which, speaking strictly, could be interpreted as "If I knew that I would not come here."

There are five verb templates which can be used to create relative clauses. The three simple tenses PAST, PRESENT and FUTURE may only be relativised in their positive sense. In addition to these, there is a tenseless positive form and a tenseless negative form. For all other verb forms, relative clauses must be formed by a periphrastic relative using "amba-". 

The following table shows the structure of the verb templates, notably the positioning of the relative morpheme, here labelled "REL". Note in the following table that the marker for the future tense is "-taka-" with a following relative morpheme, rather than the simple "-ta-" which occurs otherwise.
The relative morpheme takes one of many forms to indicate the class of its referent. The relative morpheme for each class is identical to its combining pronominal form which appears with "na-" and "ndi-". Aside from class 1, the form of each can be achieved by placing "o" (the so-called "o of reference") 
In most languages with a verbal copula, the equivalent of the verb 'to be', it is this verb that exhibits the most irregularity and the most diversity of form. Swahili is no exception. Outside of the present tense, the Swahili verb -wa (infinitive kuwa) is almost entirely regular, inflecting as other short verbs do. In the present tense, however, there is a distinction made between a copular of "essence" versus a copula of "state or location". This is similar to the distinction between "ser" and "estar" in Spanish and Portuguese, however, in Swahili, this distinction largely vanishes outside of the present tense. There are also irregular relativised forms for the present tense as well as an irregular unique continuative form.

The invariable copula ni is used, in the present tense, to express that two noun phrases (the subject and complement) refer to one and the same referent:
It is also used to express membership of a class (a subset relationship):
It may also introduce an adjective or equivalent phrase describing a relatively permanent characteristic.
The negative form si can be used in all the same situations with a negative meaning:
Because ni and si do not provide any information about the subject, personal pronouns, usually only necessary for emphasis, frequently appear. Compare the typical use of irregular present tense with that of the entirely regular past tense where the subject prefixes make personal pronouns redundant and used only for emphasis.
A sentence begun with ni or si without an overtly marked pronoun is typically translated with the subject "it" in English. With plural context, "they" may be meant.
On occasion, the invariable copula may follow regular forms of "kuwa" in other tenses. In the following example, the "ni" could also be left out.

The emphatic or focusing copula ndi- places its subject in focus, emphasising that it is "that particular referent" and not another. The emphatic copula takes suffixes matching the person and noun class of the referent. These suffixes are the same as those which combine with "na". In the first and second persons, the third person suffixes are frequently used.
<nowiki>*</nowiki> The form "sisi" "it is not us" is not frequently used as it is identical to the pronoun "sisi" "we", "us". Instead it is virtually always replaced with "sio".

Forms of the emphatic copula are frequently equivalent to a definite phrase in translation and are followed by relative verb forms as in the following example:
Compare the above with the non-emphatic version of the same sentence:
Location is indicated in the present tense by prefixing the subject concord to one of the locative clitics "-po", "-ko" and "-mo". The class 1 subject concord "a-" (negative: "ha-") is however replaced with "yu-" (negative: "hayu-").

The three clitics, "-po", "-ko" and "-mo" correspond to the locative classes 16, 17 and 18 respectively and indicate "definite", "indefinite" and "internal" location respectively. For example, "wapo" means essentially "they are here/there", "wako" means "they are around here/there" and "wamo" means "they are in here/there".
Under a very strict prescriptive viewpoint, the classes should not be mixed, for instance "nipo hapa" "I am here" is regarded as correct but "niko hapa" "I am here" is regarded as incorrect. There is, however, a broad tendency for many speakers to prefer forms with "-ko" over the other forms, such that "niko hapa" is very common. 

A large number of Swahili verbs indicate the process of entering a state. For example, the verbs "kulewa" ("to get drunk"), "kuchoka" ("to become tired") and "kuchelewa" ("to become late") describe the respective changes to state from "not drunk" to "drunk", from "not tired" to "tired" and from "not late" to "late". These may be regarded as inherently inchoative verbs. There is, however, no equivalent "stative verb" for each one that would describe being in the state of having completed that process, i.e. "to be [state]". Stative meanings such as "be drunk", "be tired" and "be late" are formed by using these inchoative verbs with the perfect marker -me- (or, in the negative, -ja-). Many words which are present in English as adjectives have no corresponding adjective in Swahili and are expressed by means of inchoative verbs.
When using inchoative verbs, compound tenses must be used to talk about states occurring at times other than the present.

New verbs are readily created from simple verbs by attaching various suffixes (often called "extensions") to the stem to get different shades of meaning by altering grammatical voice. Note that the final "-a" of common and short verbs only appears at the very end of the verb and is dropped before any suffixes. 

The reciprocal suffix -ana adds the meaning "each other" to the verb.
The subject of a reciprocal verb is generally plural, however a singular subject may be used, often followed by "na" and an additional referent.
The applicative suffix, frequently called the 'prepositional extension' in learning resources, adds one of various meanings to a verb usually represented by a preposition in English such as "to", "for", "in", "with" or even "from". The form of the applicative suffix varies, depending on vowel harmony and the reappearance of the /l/ which disappeared from an older stage of Swahili between the final two vowels. 

Loan verbs usually form their applicative forms by removing their final vowel and replacing it with either "-ia" or "-ea" according to the same rules.
The causative suffix is added to verbs to indicate a person or thing causing another person or thing to perform the action of the original verb. There are a few ways in which causatives are formed. The most common and productive causative suffix is "-isha", which follows the same rules of vowel harmony as the applicative suffix.

Short verbs have no preceding vowel so have to be learnt individually.


Loan verbs, except those ending in "-au", remove their final vowel before adding these suffixes.


These suffixes may also be added to verbs and nouns to create causative verbs from them.


There is a less common causative suffix "-iza" or "-eza" which appears with some words. Often there is more than derivation from the same word, sometimes with different meanings.

There is another means of deriving causative verbs and which results from an earlier "-y-" in the language. This "-y-" suffix combined with consonants and changed their pronunciation, palatalising or "softening" them. The following table outlines the common sound changes.

In many cases, more than one of these suffixes may be used to derive different verbs from a single verb, formed by various means. In some cases, such as with "-onyesha" "to show", two causative suffixes may appear together.

Verbs that end with "-ka" very frequently exchange this to "-sha" to form the causative, however this is much less common when the preceding syllable contains "e" or "i".


Because most of the word-final sequences of more than one vowel come from the deletion of an "l" that was present in an earlier stage of the language (and often preserved in many dialects and related languages), many verbs which today end in a sequence of two vowels are made by (removing the final "-a") and adding -za. This "-z-" results from the palatalisation ("softening") process outlined above. which was applied to the "-l-" in these verbs. The "-l-" was subsequently lost but the "-z-" was not.


The passive suffix is generally -wa. 
Verb stems that end with "l" or either of the semivowels "w" or "y" (but not "ny" as that is a single consonant written with two letters, as illustrated by "-danganywa" above) take a suffix -iwa; if the preceding syllable contains "e" or "o", it will be -ewa instead.
Verbs whose ending in one of the front vowels plus "a", (ie. the sequences "-ea" and -"ia") usually simply add "-wa." 
A few words of this group, however, add "-lewa" (after an "e") or "-liwa" (after "i"), resulting from the earlier .
As Swahili does not distinguish between the sequences /ua/ and /uwa/ or /oa/ and /owa/, the passive ending "-wa" would be inaudible on verbs, so the "-liwa" and "-lewa" endings are used instead. 
Note that the verb "-ua" "to kill" has an irregular passive form: "-uawa, although the regular "-uliwa is occasionally used.

The Kiunguja dialect, specifically the variant of it spoken in Zanzibar City, which has been made the standard dialect, goes a step further than many other dialects, requiring also that all verbs ending in "-aa" be passivised with the suffix "-liwa" even though the difference between /ɑɑ/ and /ɑwɑ/ is perfectly distinct.
The short verbs have passive forms that must be learnt separately. In each case, the passive form is one syllable longer and falls into the category of common verbs and thus does not receive the extention "-ku-" anywhere in its conjugation.
Most loan-verbs simply add "-wa".
If a loan-verb ends with a consonant followed by -u, this "u" becomes an "i" 
Loan-verbs which end in "-au" add "-liwa"
Verbs ending in "-uu" lose one "u" and replace it with "-liwa".

The agent in a sentence with a passive verb does not need to be included in the sentence. The passive verb, however, does explicitly allude to the existence of an agent, in contrast to the mediopassive below. When the agent is included in the sentence, it is introduced by the preposition "na", which is here the equivalent of the English "by", although in other contexts it is more usually equivalent to "and" or "with".

The mediopassive suffix is added to a transitive verb in order to promote its object to the role of subject without the implication of an agent. The form of the suffix involves ends in "-ka" and generally the harmonic "i" or "e" before it, although this may be dropped in verbs with a vowel final root; alternatively, the lost "l" of final vowel combinations may reappear and act as a buffer for the harmonic "i" or "e". 

As with the other derivational suffixes (or "extensions"), loan verbs generally lose their final vowel before adding -ika or -eka according to vowel harmony rules, The exceptions are those ending in -au which use "-lika'.


In learner materials, the mediopassive suffix generally erroneously described as the "stative extension" despite the fact that the resulting verbs do not generally fulfil the requirements stative: namely that they describe unchanging states. For example, the mediopassive verb "-vunjika "to break; go to pieces" contrasts with its source verb "-vunja" "to break; make go to pieces", not in the quality of being either stative or dynamic — both are dynamic, describing a process that changes over time — but in that the subject of "-vunjika" is equivalent to the object of "-vunja", and the subject of "-vunja" is completely absent from a clause with "-vunjika. In this respect, mediopassive verbs are the same as passive verbs, however they are distinguished by their incompatibility with any mention of an agent. Compare the following three examples.

Mediopassive verbs often have the appearance of being stative when used in the perfect. However, this is a function of the perfect, which focuses on the present relevance of a past action, rather than a function of the mediopassive itself. For example, the sentence ""Dirisha limevunjika,"" means either "The window has broken," or "The window is broken." What is being said is that the window broke in the past, but that the effects of this action are still relevant in the present. The verb itself, "-vunjika", does not describe the state of being broken, but rather the dynamic process of changing from "whole; in tact" to "broken; in pieces". The perfect "-me-" here indicates that we are concerned with the state after the dynamic process.

Suffixes can be stacked upon each other to make quite long verb stems with specific meanings. The passive suffix must always be last in Swahili.


Here is another rather more implausible example:

The genitive preposition "-a" (sometimes termed a "connector", "possessive" or "associative" preposition) has a similar role to that of the genitive case of some other languages. It indicates the possessor, or a more general association, and roughly corresponds in meaning to the English preposition "of". It receives a prefix that agrees with the preceding noun's class. For example:


The equivalent of English compound nouns are often formed with genitive constructions, such as "taa ya barabarani" "traffic light", "street light", which is literally equivalent to "light of road-LOC".

The personal pronouns each have their own genitive stem, for example:


The genitive preposition is formed from the subject concord of verbs (which you can see here), plus "-a". There are some sound changes that happen. "U-" and "i-" become their equivalent semivowels "w-" and "y-" respectively. After consonants, this y is generally dropped although "ki-" and "vi-" become "ch-" and "vy-". The class 1 verbal concord "a-" is an exception, being replaced with "w-" in the genitive construction.

The word "kwa" is a very frequently encountered preposition in Swahili. It may be regarded as either the class 15 or class 17 variant of "-a". Where there is no 15 or class 17 antecedent, its function is adverbial, relating to the action expressed by the sentence rather than to a particular noun within it. It may be equivalent to a wide variety of prepositions in English, but it possibly frequently equivalent to an instrumental use of "by (means of)", "using" or "with". In standard Swahili, it may indicate a location associated with an animate referent, but is replaced by "kwenye" for inanimate referents.


The ornative preposition "-enye" essentially means "having" or "with" and takes the same prefixes as the genitive -a with the exception of class 1, where it receives the prefix "mw-" instead of "w-". The word "-enye" is followed by a noun.

Dragon's Breath (dessert)

Dragon's Breath is a frozen dessert made from cereal dipped in liquid nitrogen. When placed in the eater's mouth, it produces vapors which comes out of the nose and mouth, giving the dessert its name.

Dragon's Breath is made using colorful cereal balls described as having a flavor similar to Fruit Loops. The cereal is dipped in liquid nitrogen and served in a cup. The eater uses a stick to skewer the balls. Once in the eater's mouth, the cold of the liquid nitrogen combines with the warmth of the mouth to release visible vapors out of the nose and mouth.

According to "The Straits Times", Dragon's Breath first appeared in the Philippines and South Korea circa 2015, but gained popularity when Los Angeles-based chain, Chocolate Chair, added it to its menu.

Dragon's Breath is noted for the spectacle of its consumption more than its flavor, with several publications commenting on its compatibility with Instagram trends.

Liquid nitrogen is used in several foods and drinks to quickly freeze them or for the vapors it produces. Its consumption poses several dangers to humans. The extreme cold temperature can cause damage to human tissue, and the displacement of oxygen by nitrogen can cause asphyxiation.

At a shop in Singapore in 2016, a woman was burned when the dessert stuck to her gums.

In August 2017, a South Korean boy was hospitalized and required surgery when the liquid left at the bottom of the Dragon's Breath cup caused a 5 centimeter hole in his stomach.

In October 2017, two children at the Pensacola Interstate Fair in Florida were injured while handling or consuming Dragon's Breath. A 14-year-old suffered a burn on her thumb from contact with the frozen dessert. Another child suffered second degree burns on the roof of her mouth. Following complaints, the fair's general manager announced the vendor would not be allowed to sell Dragon's Breath at the next year's event.

Alexanda Kotey

Alexanda Amon Kotey (born 13 December 1983) is a former British citizen who was captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces, who said he was fleeing from the collapse of Daesh, the short-lived "Islamic State".

Half-Ghanaian and half-Greek Cypriot, Kotey spent his youth in Shepherd's Bush. "The Daily Telegraph" reports he is a supporter of Queens Park Rangers F.C. and dreamed of joining the team when he grew up. His Syrian captors say Kotey worked as a drug dealer in London prior to his radicalisation.

In 2014 and 2015 Daesh held dozens of European and North American captives, and the brutal conditions of their detention was widely reported. Four English speaking Daesh fighters played a central role in the brutality. Their identities were initially either not known. or security officials did not make their identities known to the public, so the press dubbed the four as the Jihadi Beatles, with the most well-known being known as Jihadi John. Later Kotey was reported to have been one of the other three Beatles.

On January 10, 2017, the US Department of State formally designated Kotey as a terrorist, under the authority of Executive Order 13224. This designation prohibited US citizens, financial institutions, and other US corporations, from having any financial dealings with him.

Daesh controlled areas of Syria and Iraq underwent a steady erosion in 2015, 2016 and 2017, with their remaining enclaves collapsing in late 2017 and early 2018. Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, a friend from London, who was also reported to have been one of the Jihadi Beatles, were captured trying to flee the region, on January 24, 2018.

"The Independent" reported that the United Kingdom government was considering agreeing that Kotey and Elsheikh could be transferred to the Guantanamo detention camps.

Detention in Guantanamo might mean indefinite detention without charge; if transferred to US custody for a civilian trial and convicted, they would likely be detained at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. "The Independent" described how bleak conditions would be at the Florence Supermax, confinement to a featureless cell, for 23 hours a day, practically no human contact, exercise periods in a small featureless courtyard, near their cell.

Another option under consideration is trial at the International Court in the Hague. According to "The Independent", the UK government would first strip Kotey and Elsheikh of UK citizenship, prior to agreeing to transfer to the Hague.

"The Guardian" quoted Tobias Ellwood, the UK Minister of Defence, who argued that transfer to Guantanamo was inappropriate.

Protestant scholasticism

Protestant scholasticism was academic theology practiced by Protestant theologians using the scholastic method during the era of Calvinist and Lutheran orthodoxy in the 16th to 18th centuries. Protestant scholasticism developed out of the need to clearly define and defend church doctrine against the Catholic Church and other Protestant churches. It refers to both Lutheran scholasticism and Reformed scholasticism. Anglicanism never developed a scholastic theology; however, Anglican writers in the 1600s studied early Christian writings to prove that Anglicanism had faithfully followed the teachings and practices of the early Church.

Protestant scholasticism "became the dominant organizational approach to teaching theology in the academies" before its influence began to wane in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Denver Moon

Denver Moon is a science fiction/mystery series by Joshua Viola and Warren Hammond that consists of a novella, comic book series/graphic novel, short stories and a soundtrack. Multiple critics and review sites refer to Denver Moon as "Blade Runner" meets "Total Recall". "Denver Moon" is the protagonist, a Mars-born female detective of Japanese descent, who is accompanied by her sidekick Smith, an AI merged with her late grandfather’s memories and installed in her Smith & Wesson pistol. Denver is colorblind, which plays a role in the story, as most Mars inhabitants are affected by a mysterious disease known as Red Fever. Monochromatics, such as Denver, are immune. The novella, "The Minds of Mars", follows Denver as she unravels the mystery of her grandfather’s twenty-year-old death and the world-changing secrets he took to his grave that could change Mars forever. 


"Denver Moon: Metamorphosis" is a short story prequel to the novella’s events and follows Denver as she investigates the death of multiple sex bots. The short story also inspired the 3-issue comic book series. 

The "Denver Moon" comic book series is a three-issue mini-series available in print and digital through comixology. A killer stalks and murders sex bots called botsies and salvages their body parts. Denver Moon investigates the case. 


"Denver Moon: Metamorphosis" collects all three comic book issues.

The "Denver Moon" soundtrack includes music by Klayton (a frequent collaborator of Viola), Celldweller, Scandroid, and Blue Stahli.

MRI artifact

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a visual artifact is an anomaly during visual representation. It is a feature appearing in an image that is not present in the original object. Many different artifacts can occur
during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), some affecting the diagnostic quality, while others may be confused with pathology. Artifacts can be classified as patient-related, signal processing-dependent and hardware (machine)-related. 

Motion is one of the most common
artifacts in MR imaging, causing
either ghost images or diffuse image
noise in the phase-encoding direction.
The reason for mainly affecting data
sampling in the phase-encoding
direction is the significant difference
in the time of acquisition in the frequency-
and phase-encoding directions.

Frequency-encoding sampling
in all the rows of the matrix (128, 256
or 512) takes place during a single
echo (milliseconds). Phase-encoded
sampling takes several seconds, or
even minutes, owing to the collection
of all the k-space lines to enable
Fourier analysis. Major physiological
movements are of millisecond to seconds
duration and thus too slow to
affect frequency-encoded sampling,
but they have a pronounced effect in
the phase-encoding direction.
Periodic movements such as cardiac
movement and blood vessel or
CSF pulsation cause ghost images,
while non-periodic movement causes
diffuse image noise (Fig. 1). Ghost
image intensity increases with amplitude
of movement and the signal
intensity from the moving tissue.
Several methods can be used to
reduce motion artifacts, including
patient immobilisation, cardiac and
respiratory gating, signal suppression
of the tissue causing the artifact,
choosing the shorter dimension of the
matrix as the phase-encoding direction,
view-ordering or phase-reordering
methods and swapping phaseand
frequency-encoding directions to
move the artifact out of the field of
interest.

Flow can manifest as either altered
intravascular signal (flow enhancement
or flow-related signal loss), or
flow-related artifacts (ghost images or
spatial misregistration).
Flow enhancement, also known as
inflow effect, is caused by fully magnetised
protons entering the imaged slice
while the stationary protons have not
fully regained their magnetization.

The fully magnetized protons yield a
high signal in comparison with the
rest of the surroundings.
High velocity flow causes the protons
entering the image to be removed
from it by the time the 180-degree
pulse is administered. The effect is
that these protons do not contribute
to the echo and are registered as a signal
void or flow-related signal loss
(Fig. 2).

Spatial misregistration manifests
as displacement of an intravascular
signal owing to position encoding of a
voxel in the phase direction preceding
frequency encoding by time TE/2.The
intensity of the artifact is dependent
on the signal intensity from the vessel,
and is less apparent with increased TE.

Metal artifacts occur at interfaces
of tissues with different magnetic susceptibilities,
which cause local magnetic
fields to distort the external
magnetic field. This distortion
changes the precession frequency in
the tissue leading to spatial mismapping
of information. The degree of
distortion depends on the type of
metal (stainless steel having a greater
distorting effect than titanium alloy),
the type of interface (most striking
effect at soft tissue-metal interfaces),
pulse sequence and imaging parameters.
Metal artifacts are caused by external
ferromagnetics such as cobalt
containing make-up, or internal ferromagnetics
such as surgical clips,
spinal hardware and other orthopaedic
devices.Manifestation of these
artifacts is variable, including total
signal loss, peripheral high signal and
image distortion (Figs 3 and 4).

Reduction of these artifacts can be
attempted by orientating the long axis
of an implant or device parallel to the
long axis of the external magnetic
field, possible with mobile extremity
imaging and an open magnet.
Further methods used are choosing
the appropriate frequency encoding
direction, since metal artifacts are
most pronounced in this direction,
using smaller voxel sizes, fast imaging
sequences, increased readout bandwidth
and avoiding gradient-echo
imaging when metal is present. A
technique called MARS (metal artifact
reduction sequence) applies an
additional gradient, along the slice
select gradient at the time the frequency
encoding gradient is applied.

The ways in which the data are
sampled, processed and mapped out
on the image matrix manifest these
artifacts.

Chemical shift artifact occurs at
the fat/water interface in the phase
encoding or section-select directions
(Fig. 5). These artifacts arise due to
the difference in resonance of protons
as a result of their micromagnetic
environment. The protons of fat resonate
at a slightly lower frequency
than those of water. High field
strength magnets are particularly susceptible
to this artifact.

Determination of the artifact can
be made by swapping the phase- and
frequency-encoding gradients and
examining the resultant shift (if any)
of the tissues.

Partial volume artifacts arise from the size of the voxel over which the signal is averaged. Objects smaller than the voxel dimensions lose their identity, and loss of detail and spatial resolution occurs. Reduction of these artifacts is accomplished by using a smaller pixel size and/or a smaller slice
thickness.

This artifact is a result of mismapping
of anatomy that lies outside the
field of view but within the slice volume.
The selected field of view is
smaller than the size of the imaged
object. The anatomy is usually displaced
to the opposite side of the
image (Figs 6 and 7). It can be caused
by non-linear gradients or by undersampling
of the frequencies contained
within the return signal.

The sampling rate must be twice
the maximal frequency that occurs in
the object (Nyquist sampling limit). If
not, the Fourier transform will assign
very low values to the frequency signals
greater than the Nyquist limit.
These frequencies will then ‘wrap
around’ to the opposite side of the
image, masquerading as low-frequency
signals. In the frequency encode
direction a filter can be applied to the
acquired signal to eliminate frequencies
greater than the Nyquist frequency.
In the phase encode direction, artifacts
can be reduced by an increasing
number of phase encode steps
(increased image time). For correction,
a larger field of view may be chosen.

This is caused by the under-sampling
of high spatial frequencies at
sharp boundaries in the image. Lack
of appropriate high-frequency components
leads to an oscillation at a
sharp transition known as a ringing
artifact. The artifact occurs near the
sharp boundaries, where high contrast
transitions in the object occur. It
appears as multiple, regularly spaced
parallel bands of alternating bright
and dark signal that slowly fade with
distance (Fig. 8). Ringing artifacts are
more prominent in smaller digital
matrix sizes.

Methods employed to correct
Gibbs artifact include filtering the Kspace
data prior to Fourier transform,
increasing the matrix size for a given
field of view, the Gegenbauer reconstruction
and Bayesian approach.

This is a wide, still expanding subject
and should be discussed separately.
Only a few common artifacts that
should be recognised are mentioned.
When in doubt, however, a technician
should be consulted.

RF detection circuit failure arises
from improper detector channel
operation. Fourier-transformed data
display a bright spot in the centre of
the image. If one channel of the detector
has a higher gain than the other it
will result in object ghosting in the
image. This is the result of a hardware
failure and must be addressed by a
service representative.

B0 inhomogeneity leads to mismapping
of tissues. Inhomogeneous
external magnetic field causes either
spatial, intensity, or both distortions.
Intensity distortion occurs when the
field in a location is greater or less than
in the rest of the imaged object
(Fig. 9). Spatial distortion results
from long-range field gradients, which remain constant in the inhomogeneous
field.

Magnetic field gradients are used
to spatially encode the location of signals
from excited protons within the
volume being imaged. The slice select
gradient defines the volume (slice).
Phase- and frequency-encoding gradients
provide the information in the
other two dimensions. Any deviation
in the gradient would be represented
as a distortion.

As the distance increases from the
centre of the applied gradient, loss of
field strength occurs at the periphery.
Anatomical compression occurs and
is especially pronounced on coronal
and sagittal imaging.

When the phase-encoding gradient
is different, the width or height of
the voxel are different, resulting in distortion.
Anatomical proportions are
compressed along one or the other
axis. Square pixels (and voxels) should
be obtained.

Ideally the phase gradient should
be assigned to the smaller dimension
of the object and the frequency gradient
to the larger dimension. In practice
this is not always possible because
of the necessity of displacing motion
artifacts.

This may be corrected by reducing
the field of view, by lowering the gradient
field strength or by decreasing
the frequency bandwidth of radio signal.
If correction is not achieved, the
cause might be either a damaged gradient
coil or an abnormal current
passing through the gradient coil.

Variation in intensity across the
image may be due to the failure of the
RF coil, non-uniform B1 field, nonuniform
sensitivity of the receive only
coil (spaces between wire in the coil,
uneven distribution of wire), or presence
of non-ferromagnetic material in
the imaged object.

There is a uniform decrease in signal
intensity along the frequencyencoding
axis. Signal drop-off is due
to filters that are too tight about the
signal band. Some of the signal generated
by the imaged section is, thereby,
inappropriately rejected. A similar
artifact may be caused by non-uniformity
in slice thickness.

RF pulses and precessional frequencies
of MRI instruments occupy
the same frequency bandwidth
as common sources such as TV,
radio, fluorescent lights and computers.
Stray RF signals can cause various
artifacts. Narrow-band noise is
projected perpendicular to the frequency-
encoding direction. Broadband
noise disrupts the image over
a much larger area.Appropriate site
planning, proper installation and
RF shielding (Faraday cage) eliminate
stray RF interference.

A bright linear signal in a dashed pattern
that decreases in intensity
across the screen and can occur as a
line or star pattern, depending on
the position of the patient in the
‘phase-frequency space’.

Zero line and star artifacts are
due to system noise or any cause of
RF pollution within the room
(Faraday cage). If this pattern persists,
check for sources of system
noise such as bad electronics or
alternating current line noise, loose
connections to surface coils, or any
source of RF pollution. If a star pattern
is encountered, the manufacturer
should readjust the system
software so that the image is moved
off the zero point.

Although less
common, stars/zippers are bands
through the image centre due to an
imperfect Faraday cage, with RF
pollution in, but originating from
outside, the cage.
Residual free induction decay
stimulated echo also causes
stars/zippers.

These are patchy areas of
increased or decreased signal intensity.
This artifact is produced by
variations in RF energy required to
tip protons 90 or 180 degrees within
the selected slice volume.

Absence of signal from tissues of
a particular T1 value is a consequence
of magnitude sensitive
reconstruction in inversion recovery
imaging. When the chosen T1
equals 69% of the T1 value of a
particular tissue, a bounce point
artifact occurs.

Use phase-sensitive reconstruction
inversion recovery techniques.

Close to the surface coil the signals
are very strong resulting in a
very intense image signal (Fig. 10).

Further from the coil the signal
strength drops rapidly due to the
attenuation with a loss of image
brightness and significant shading
to the uniformity. Surface coil sensitivity
intensifies problems related
to RF attenuation and RF mismatching.

Non-uniform RF energy received
by adjacent slices during a multi-slice
acquisition is due to cross-excitation
of adjacent slices with contrast loss in
reconstructed images (Fig. 11).
To overcome these interference
artifacts, include the acquisition of
two independent sets of gapped
multi-slice images, subsequently
reordered during display of the full
image set.

Tata LPTA

The Tata LPTA is a military truck family developed and produced by Indian automobile manufacturer Tata Motors. The trucks are available in 4×4,6×6,8×8,10×10 and 12×12 configurations. With extreme off-road capabilities,they are proposed as replacement for Czech-designed Tatra trucks currently used by Indian armed forces.

The Indian Army is one of the biggest users of Tatra trucks in the world with over 10,000 trucks of various types in service.Because of their high-operational flexibility and functional adaptability they formed the backbone of army's tactical & mobilisation capability. These trucks were license-produced in India by BEML,a public sector company. Following the Tatra bribery scam, a ban was imposed on Tatra and the supply of these trucks stopped. Thus,the development of multi axle tactical trucks was started by Tata to meet Army's requirements.

The vehicles have COE modular design. The cab can hold 2 crew and 4 passengers. There are 2 roof hatches for firing, observation and emergency exit. The trucks are equipped with a hydraulic crane for loading/unloading equipments. They also come with Central tire inflation system which inflates/deflates tyres according to terrain requirements. For driver's comfort,cab is equipped with HVAC. There's a self recovery winch in the front as well.

The 6×6 and 8×8 variants are powered by a Cummins ISLe engine developing 375 HP while the 12×12 variant comes with a Cummins ISXe engine that developes 525 HP. 4×4,6×6,8×8 variants are mated to a 10 speed(9F+1R) manual transmission while the 12×12 variant comes with an automatic transmission.

In July 2015, Tata won a contract for supplying 1,239 trucks of 6×6 variant to the Indian Army. In March 2016, an additional order for 619 more trucks was placed. The total order was worth 1300 crores making it the biggest order to a local private supplier.

The 8×8 variant has been selected to be the platform for SPYDER Short Range Surface to Air Missiles. Tata has also proposed the 12×12 variant for Nirbhay missile Transporter erector launcher and 8×8 for Pinaka MBRL.

Around 15,000 trucks of 4×4 variant are also in service with Indian Army.

<doc id="56564649" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56564649" title="Klau and Buena Vista Mine Superfund site">
Klau and Buena Vista Mine Superfund site

The Klau/Buena Vista Mine is a Superfund site located approximately 12 miles west of Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo County, California. It consists of two abandoned mercury mine sites (Klau and Buena Vista) that are located on adjacent properties on a northwest-southeast ridge of the Santa Lucia Range in the California coastal mountains. Mercury mining and ore processing operations occurred at these mines between 1868 and 1970.

Episodic weather events left deep erosional channels throughout the site, thereby releasing mercury-laden sediment, which had contributed significant levels of mercury to downstream Las Tablas Creek and Lake Nacimiento Reservoir.

The Klau Mine opened in 1868 and yielded nearly 18,000 flasks of mercury by 1940. Operation of the Buena Vista or Mahoney mine started in 1900 and was active until 1970. The Buena Vista mine produced more than 15,000 flasks of mercury. Buena Vista Mines, Inc. has owned the Buena Vista Mine at least since 1957 and the Klau Mine since at least 1964.

For more than 20 years, acid-contaminated water has drained from the mine into Las Tablas Creek. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) ordered the Buena Vista Mines, Inc. to stop discharging water or treat the water before it was released into the creek. In 1994, the company constructed an earthen holding pond to capture the mine water and evaporate it. The pond was built from an existing cattle pond, dug 12 feet deep, and designed to hold 1.5 million gallons of acid-contaminated water. In early 1995, San Luis Obispo County experienced heavy rains. Buena Vista Mines inspected the pond on March 24, 1995 and noticed that the water was one inch from the top. Using a water pump, they pumped out 180,000 gallons and lowered the water level about by 18 inches. David Schwartzbart, an engineering geologist for RWQCB, observed the water run down a concrete channel into the Las Tablas Creek. Schwartzbart tested the water and determined that it was highly acidic. After the criminal charges were brought, Buena Vista Mines constructed a second pond that had a 1,200,000-gallon capacity. They also installed a treatment facility that could treat 10,000 gallons of water per day.

In 1999, the RWQCB requested the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 9’s Emergency Response Office to assist in preventing the continued release of mercury-laden sediments and other contaminants from the site. Short-term removal work involved site stabilization, which reduced the discharge of acid mine drainage (AMD) and discharge into Las Tablas Creek. In 2000, EPA removed 120,000 cubic yards of contaminated materials from the drainage channel and secured it in an on-site repository to prevent immediate threats to human health and the environment. In 2002, EPA stabilized a sinkhole on site and also stabilized a slope failure on site. In 2006, EPA removed the mercury processing building (retort) and some mercury-laden soils. Contaminated materials stored on site are temporarily capped and will be addressed in the site’s long-term cleanup.

During an investigation conducted by California Department of Health Services (CDHS) and Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in February-March 2006, elevated levels of mercury that pose health hazard were found in six species of fish from Lake Nacimiento. Water analysis has shown that the water is safe to drink and recreate in. However, mercury in the sediment has been converted to methylmercury by organisms living in the sediment and then there has been bioaccumulation of methylmercury in fish in the lake.

EPA has spent about $6 million so far to contain the dangerous runoff from the Klau/Buena Vista. The owner, Buena Vista Mines, Inc., began the effort after years of court battles with the state water board. Shortly after the cleanup started, it became too expensive and the mining company quit. In 1999, RWQCB requested EPA to assist on preventing the release of the mercury-laden sediments to water reservoir. The cleanup is paid for by an EPA Superfund.

It was alleged that the Buena Vista Mines, Inc. intentionally violated the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act by discharging pollutants into Las Tablas Creek which flows into Lake Nacimiento. In January 20, 1998, the Court of Appeal, 2 District, Division 6, California dismissed the violations on the ground that the mine had established a defense of necessity.

Pashtun Tahafuz Movement

The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (, ; abbreviated PTM), or the Pashtun Protection Movement, formerly called the Mehsud Tahafuz Movement (MTM), is a social movement for Pashtun human rights, based in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan, Pakistan. The movement originally started in 2014 as an initiative for removing land mines from Waziristan, affected by the war in North-West Pakistan. 

It later rose to prominence in January 2018 when it began a justice movement for Naqeebullah Mehsud, who was killed extrajudicially during a police encounter in Karachi that same month. The leader of the movement is Manzoor Pashteen, a human rights activist from South Waziristan.

On January 26, 2018, the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement organized a protest march starting from Dera Ismail Khan, passing through Lakki Marwat, Bannu, Karak, Kohat, and Darra Adam Khel, and reaching Peshawar on January 28. Then after passing through Charsadda, Mardan, Swabi, and Tarnol, the march reached Islamabad, where a sit-in called "All Pashtun National Jirga" was organized from February 1. The jirga condemned the murder of the Pashtun shopkeeper Naqeebullah Mehsud who was shot dead by police force in Karachi during an encounter, and the alleged state oppression against the Pashtuns. It asked the government to set up a judicial inquiry for Naqeebullah Mehsud, as well as for all the other Pashtuns murdered extrajudicially in police encounters. The jirga demanded to stop racial profiling of the Pashtuns in Pakistan, and to bring the Pashtun missing persons before the court of law, so that those who are innocent but held could be freed. The jirga also demanded Pakistan Army to guarantee that they will not abduct or open fire on innocents in the tribal areas, or use violence or collective punishment against entire villages and tribes, and that they will not impose the frequent curfews on the movement of locals even after minor incidents. Another demand was to remove all land mines planted in the tribal areas, which have resulted in many civilian casualties. The protesters said that since 2009, more than 35 people including children had been killed due to land mines in South Waziristan alone. 

The sit-in in Islamabad ended on February 10, but the organizers of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement announced that they would reconvene the protest if their demands were not fulfilled by the government. Advisor to Prime Minister on political affairs, Engr. Amir Muqam appeared in front of the protesters with the hand-written agreement from the Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi that included three clauses, agreeing to apprehend Rao Anwar, speed-up the clearing of Mines in South Waziristan, an intermediate college establishment in name of Naqeebullah Mehsud, and promised to addressed "genuine gravencies" raised by Jirga members. Muqam also told the protestors, “the way you held the peaceful protest is really commendable and others should learn a lesson to record their protests this way. I’ll stand by you in trying times and you can come to discuss with me all of your legitimate issues anytime.”

There was grand gathering of PTM in the center of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar on 8th April, 2018. More than 60 thousand people joined the protest. Their main demands are as follows:

Pakistan's mainstream television channels and media outlets are not reporting and covering the activities of the PTM. Their only medium to interact with the rest of Pakistan and to keep them updated is through social media. This further strengthens their narrative of being sidelined and ignored by the system.

On March 23, the PTM meeting was scheduled to be held in Peshawar University, but Deputy Commissioner Peshawar Islam Zeb, issued an order under section 144 CrPC, imposing ban on political meetings in University and satted any violation against the order shall be preceded against u/s 188 PPC and order will be exercised "for 30 days unless modified or withdrawn." Later the meeting was held in Baghi-e-Naran, Hayatabad with 200 person attending the gathering.

Woolundunga, South Australia

Woolundunga is a locality in the Australian state of South Australia located on the western side of the Flinders Ranges about north of the state capital of Adelaide and about south-east of the city of Port Augusta.

Boundaries for the part of Woolundunga within the City of Port Augusta in the west were proclaimed on 17 February 1994 while the part within the District Council of Mount Remarkable in the east was added on 13 March 1997.

The locality’s name is of Aboriginal origin and is considered by the South Australian historian, Geoffrey Manning, to be derived from the name of “springs near Mount Brown” claimed to belong to a group of Aboriginal people with “the same name.” The name was used in 1851 for a pastoral enterprise called the ‘Woolundunga Run’ which was established by J. Pat(t)erson on pastoral lease no. 32 and which was located in part of the locality due to the presence of two homestead ruins both bearing the name within the current boundaries.

Woolundunga is bounded in part by roads including the Horrocks Pass Road (B56) which passes through the pass of the same name on its southern side and the Augusta Highway which forms its western boundary.
Land use within the locality is concerned with ‘primary industry’ activities dominated by pastoralism and other classes of agriculture with land in the locality’s east being zoned to preserve “the natural and rural character and scenic features.”

Woolundunga is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Stuart and the local government areas of the City of Port Augusta and the District Council of Mount Remarkable.

Kirstie Clements

Kirstie Clements (born 23 March 1962) is an Australian author, editor, journalist and speaker. Clements served as Editor-in-Chief of Vogue Australia for thirteen years from 1999 to 2012, and is currently Director and Chief Creative Officer for luxury lingerie brand Porte-á-Vie.

Clements was born on 23 March 1962 in Sydney, Australia. She grew up in the Sutherland Shire, a local government area in the southern region of Sydney, New South Wales. Clements has one older brother, Anthony. Their father passed away of a brain tumor when Clements was five years old.

In her youth, Clements attended Sylvania High School. She described her desire to leave her hometown at an early age stating, “Not to dismiss it, but at that point I was much more interested in the band scene. I was interested in punk, in literature, in magazines, in popular culture, and the Shire wasn’t where I was going to get that from."

At the age of sixteen, Clements moved to the Sydney suburb of Darlinghurst with her mother Gloria. Describing herself as poor, Clements would often shop at disposal stores and op-shops in order to discover clothing and fashion.

At the age of 23, Clements was working in a bookstore when she saw a job being advertised in the newspaper for receptionist at Vogue Australia. Clements immediately applied for the position and was granted an interview. The last of twenty different girls to be interviewed, Clements met with a woman described as “probably in her late 60s. Glamorous; white blonde hair, blue eyes, great legs, she was gorgeous. It was about six o'clock at night and she was drinking out of a tea cup, and I’m sure it was gin… I loved her immediately and she hired me.” Clements began working behind the reception desk the very next day.

Clements quickly moved on from the reception desk, taking on various jobs within the Vogue Australia offices. Describing her quick promotion, Clements stated, “I just put my hand up for everything. My key to success is to make yourself useful, just put you hand up for everything… and you’ll find what you shine at. Essentially I found I wasn’t very good at taking orders, but I was really good at giving them”

Clements departed Vogue Australia in the early 1990s to move to Paris and work as a freelance journalist.

Clements returned to Australia in 1997 where she briefly worked as Beauty Editor for "Vogue Australia" before joining glossy magazine rival "Harper’s Bazaar." Clements was brought on as Associate Editor for the magazine and worked there for just over two years from 1997 to 1999.

Clements returned to "Vogue Australia" in 1999 to be hired as the magazine’s Editor-in-Chief. Clements succeeded Juliet Ashworth who was former Editor-in-Chief from 1998-1999. Clements described her return to "Vogue Australia" as a challenge to rebuild its image following a demise in the 1990s. She stated, “"Vogue" was pretty broken at that point… When I went back it took three years to build it back to what I felt was a standard that it should have been.”

Early on in her career as Editor-in-Chief, while working on a November issue, Clements was faced with an almost empty roster of booked advertisements with mere weeks to go. With a goal of 120 pages of ads, the magazine had booked just one advertisement due to a staff error. This forced Clements to undertake a restaffing of the entire office. Commenting on her preferences for staff hires, she stated, “I liked to have a local staff, and an Australian staff. I didn’t like to use freelancers that much if I could help it.”

When interviewing applicants for potential positions at "Vogue Australia", Clements remarked how surprised she was by the number of young girls who expressed an obsession with a fashion label instead of an original style or desire to make things. She elaborated by stating that she was “always highly dubious because I wanted them to have a passion for art, for books, for culture, for literature, for dance, for theatre, for costume design... anything but, as a matter of fact, fashion… I didn’t want people who were obsessed with labels, and I still stand by that.”

Discussing her approach to management at "Vogue Australia", Clements stated, “I learnt how to be diplomatic. I think most of my job was diplomacy. Diplomacy between staff members, diplomacy between management, diplomacy to clients, to creatives.” She commented that working with creatives was more rewarding than collaborating with any other worker due to their passion and vision. “They don’t care about the bonus, they don’t really care about the wage, but they care about the product, and if you can actually equip them with the materials, and the idea, and the vision, then they really can just run on praise.”

In November 2006, Australian media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s News Limited (rebranded as News Corp on 1 July 2013) acquired Independent Print Media Group’s FPC Magazines which included Vogue Australia. News Limited placed management of the newly acquired FPC magazines ("Notebook, Delicious, Super Food Ideas, & Vogue Australia)" under its NewsLifeMedia branch.

Clements was fired from her position as editor-in-chief six years after the News Limited acquisition, on 16 May 2012. She was called into a meeting with NewsLifeMedia CEO Nicole Sheffield who directed her to collect he belongings and depart the "Vogue Australia" offices immediately without offering an explanation as to why she was being fired. Clements left the office and went to have a drink at Bondi’s Icebergs bar while news of her departure was announced.

Clements was succeeded by Edwina McCann, former editor-in-chief of rival magazine "Harper’s Bazaar Australia." Reflecting on the abrupt outing, Clements claimed “I was part of an old guard, and they wanted a new guard, new management and a new vision. I don’t know if there is any way of doing that without it being a bloodbath.”

The day after her firing from "Vogue Australia," Clements received a phone call from Louise Adler of Melbourne University Press who invited her to write a book about her career. Clements soon after signed a book publishing deal with Melbourne University Press to publish an auto-biography titled "The Vogue Factor". The book was published in February 2013 and detailed Clements memoirs of her 25 year career at "Vogue Australia." The book went on to become a bestseller in a number of markets worldwide, and Clements made an appearance on US talk show "The View" which was hosted by Barbara Walters to discuss the book"." "The Vogue Factor" was released in the UK by Faber and Faber in July 2013, with a US edition following in February 2014 published by Chronicle"."

Clements described writing the book as a cathartic experience which encouraged her to look back at her time with "Vogue Australia" with fondness despite the way she was let go.

Following the release of "The Vogue Factor," Clements wrote the novel "Tongue in Chic," which was published in November 2013 by Victory Books and is described as a behind the scenes exposé of the fashion and luxury magazine industries. Clements also co-authored "Fashion, The First Fifty Years from The Australian Women’s Weekly," which was published by the National Library Australia in 2014.

From 2014 to 2017, Clements worked as a Creative Consultant and Editorial Ambassador for Australian department store chain Myer and contributed to its "Myer Emporium Magazine", a custom magazine owned by Bauer Media Australia. During this time, Clements also launched an independent publishing house and content production company, Imprint Agency. She currently serves as its director.

In March 2017, Clements co-launched luxury lingerie brand Porte-á-Vie with former colleague Lisa Hili. She serves as the company’s director and chief creative officer.

Clements often makes public speaking appearances and contributes to a number of fashion and beauty publications such as "The New Daily." She is a Board Director for FARE (Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education) and an ambassador for Australian children’s cancer charity Camp Quality.

Clements appeared on Australian TV show "Australia’s Next Top Model" Cycle 4 which aired from 22 April - 1 July 2008. She served as a guest judge on a panel alongside Alex Perry and Charlotte Dawson.

In June 1992, while Clements was working as a freelance journalist in Paris she married French-Algerian nightclub bouncer Mourad Ayat. Clements met Ayat while covering collections and moved to Paris to live with him. Following their marriage and a stint working in Paris, the couple moved back to Australia in late 1997 with their two sons. They separated in April 2007.

Clements is a mother to twin sons, Sam and Joseph Ayat (born 1995) from her marriage to Mourad Ayat. Her son Sam Ayat signed as a model to Chadwicks modelling agency in 2014.

Clements and her sons reside in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.

<doc id="56565147" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56565147" title="Horncastle helmet fragment">
Horncastle helmet fragment

The Horncastle helmet fragment is a decorated Anglo-Saxon boar's head that likely was once attached to the crest of a helmet. Dating to the first half of the seventh century AD, it was discovered in 2002 by a metal detectorist searching in the town of Horncastle, Lincolnshire. It was reported as found treasure and purchased for £15,000 by the City and County Museum, now known as The Collection, in Lincoln. As of 2018 the museum has the fragment on display.

The long fragment is made of silver. The elongated head is semi-naturalistic, and depicts a crouching quadruped on either side of the skull. A mane divides the head down the centre. Garnets form the boar's eyes, and its eyebrows, skull, mouth, tusks, and snout are gilded. The head is hollow; in the space underneath, which was filled with soil and plant matter when found, are three rivets that would have affixed the fragment to a larger object, such as a helmet. The fragment would likely have formed the terminal of one of the "crested helmets" used in Northern Europe during the sixth through eleventh centuries.

The boar's head terminal is one of several representations of the animal on contemporary helmets. Boars surmount the Benty Grange and Wollaston helmets, and form the ends of the eyebrows of the Sutton Hoo helmet. These evidence a thousand-years-long tradition in Germanic mythology associating the boar with the gods, and with protection. The Roman historian Tacitus suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke the protection of a mother goddess, while in the Anglo-Saxon epic "Beowulf", the poet writes of boar symbols on helmets keeping watch over the warriors wearing them.

The boar's head is made of silver, parts of which are gilded, and has garnet eyes. It is long, and semi-naturalistic in style. The head is elongated; a prominent mane runs down the middle and terminates in a blunt snout, indicated by three grooved and gilded lines. On each side above the snout are more grooved and gilded lines representing the mouth, including pointed tusks. Two small eyes are formed with lentoid cabochon garnets set in beaded gold filigree work with a double collar. Two gilded eyebrows, cast in relief, are well clear of the eyes and set against the skull. This is also gilded, and repeats on either side the pattern of a crouching quadruped with three toes on front and back feet and head twisted backwards, its jaws biting across its body and back foot.

The fragment is hollow, and was found filled with soil and plant roots. Three rivets on the underside—one near the mouth, two on the opposite end—would have served to attach it to a larger object, most likely a helmet.

The fragment was found on 1 May 2002 in Horncastle, a market town in Lincolnshire, England. It was found by a Mr D. Turner, who was searching with a metal detector. As required of found objects more than 300 years old and with more than a 10% silver content, it was reported under the Treasure Act 1996, and subsequently declared treasure. It was valued at £15,000, and purchased by the City and County Museum, Lincoln—now known simply as The Collection. Funds for the acquisition were raised from the Art Fund, the MLA/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, Friends of Lincoln Museum & Art Gallery, and the Lincolnshire County Council Heritage Service Purchase Fund. As of 2018 the fragment is on display at The Collection amidst a variety of Anglo-Saxon grave goods.

The boar is of Anglo-Saxon origin, and is dated to the first half of the seventh century AD. Although its original purpose can not be conclusively determined, the style and size of the boar suggests that it formed the terminal of a helmet crest. Figural terminals adorn the crests of many contemporary helmets, such as the Sutton Hoo helmet, which has a dragon terminal at either end, and the Staffordshire helmet, which features a horse head terminal. Boar iconography is also found on helmets from the period, typically on the crests, as with the Benty Grange, Wolasston and Guilden Morden examples, or at the ends of the eyebrows, as on those from Sutton Hoo and perhaps York. The Horncastle fragment, with its lentoid eyes, tusks, and defined mane, is stylistically similar to the boar atop the Benty Grange helmet.

Taken in context, the boar would likely have adorned an early model of the "crested helmets" known in Northern Europe in the sixth through eleventh centuries AD. Such helmets are characterised by a rounded cap and usually a prominent nose-to-nape crest, from which the name of the helmet type derives and at one end of which the Horncastle boar was probably once attached.

The boar was an important symbol in prehistoric Europe, where it was "venerated, eulogised, hunted and eaten ... for millennia, until its virtual extinction in recent historical time." Anglo-Saxon boar symbols follow a thousand years of similar iconography, coming after La Tène examples in the fourth century BC, Gaulish examples three centuries later, and Roman boars in the fourth century AD. They likely represent a fused tradition of European and Mediterranean cultures. The boar is said to have been sacred to a mother goddess figure among linguistically Celtic communities in Iron Age Europe, while the Roman historian Tacitus, writing around the first century AD, suggested that the Baltic Aesti wore boar symbols in battle to invoke her protection. Boar-crested helmets are depicted on the turn of the millennium Gundestrup cauldron, discovered in Denmark, and on a Torslunda plate from Sweden, made some five hundred years later. Though the Romans also included the boar in their stable of symbols—four legions, including the twentieth, adopted it as their emblem—it was only one among many. The boar nonetheless persisted in continental Germanic tradition during the nearly 400 years of Roman rule in Britain, such as in association with the Scandinavian gods Freyja and Freyr. Its return to prominence in the Anglo-Saxon period, as represented by the boars from Benty Grange, Wollaston, Guilden Morden, and Horncastle, may therefore suggest the post-Roman reintroduction of a Germanic tradition from Europe, rather than the continuation of a tradition in Britain through 400 years of Roman rule. Whatever its precise symbolism, the Anglo-Saxon boar appears to have been associated with protection; the "Beowulf" poet makes this clear, writing that boar symbols on helmets kept watch over the warriors wearing them.

Symphony No. 12 (Glass)

Symphony No. 12 "Lodger" is the twelfth symphony by the American composer Philip Glass. The work was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and will premiere January 10, 2019, with John Adams conducting the LA Phil at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. The European premiere will follow in May 2019 with a performance by the London Contemporary Orchestra at Southbank Centre. 

Based on David Bowie's 1979 album "Lodger", it completes Glass's trilogy of symphonies based on Bowie's Berlin Trilogy of albums, which previously inspired Glass's first and fourth symphonies, based on "Low" and ""Heroes"", respectively. Glass had indicated his intent to write this third work as early as 1997, when he told the "Los Angeles Times" that he had discussed approaches to its composition with Bowie.

Project Wickenby

Project Wickenby was a long-running joint-agency investigation initiated by the Australian Government in 2005 to combat offshore tax evasion. The investigation was jointly run by the Australian Taxation Office, Australian Securities and Investment Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission

After 76 people were charged and 46 convictions recorded, the investigation concluded on 30 June 2015.

According to the Australian Taxation Office, Project Wickenby was responsible for recouping $985.67million.

Although Project Wickenby became public in 2005, the operation was prompted by the discovery of a laptop computer during an Australian Crime Commission raid in February 2004, when the hotel suite at the Sheraton Towers in Melbourne where Swiss accountant Philip Egglishaw was staying was searched. Egglishaw was meeting with corporate lawyer Michael Brereton, who is believed to have been the target of the raid. However, Egglishaw's seized laptop was discovered to have the details of hundreds of Australians allegedly linked to his offshore accountancy business, Strachans, based in the Channel Islands.

During Project Wickenby, numerous examples of fraudulent activities were uncovered including false invoices, sham loans, fake asset transfers, hidden share trading and sham labour hire along with various dubious ways of repatriating funds back to Australia such as holding accounts offshore to avoid audit trails.

Project Wickenby is noted for investigating several high-profile figures including actors Paul Hogan and John Cornell as well as music industry executive Glenn Wheatley.

Former cricketers Allan Border and Shane Warne were also questioned during the investigation.

Cornell and Hogan were eventually cleared of any wrongdoing and reached a "without admission" settlement with the ATO in 2012. Hogan had been previously banned from leaving Australia after attending his mother's funeral in 2010 while the ATO pursued Hogan.

However, Wheatley pleaded guilty in 2007 to three tax-related charges including a failure to declare nearly $300,000 he made from a John Farnham tour and his earnings from a 2003 Kostya Tszyu boxing match. Wheatley was sentenced to fifteen months in prison by the Victorian County Court.

Three company directors who were arrested in June 2005 on the Gold Coast were the first to be charged as part of the investigation. The Gold Coast businessmen were named as Adam Hargraves and two shareholders in his publishing company Phone Directories Co (PDC), his brother Glenn Hargraves and Daniel Stoten.

The three men were arrested after police raided their homes, the company's head office and the home of Adam Hargraves' accountant. Phone Directories Co Pty Ltd published telephone books in regional areas of Australia including Rockhampton and Mackay. The company is now known as Local Directories.

While Glenn Hargraves was later found not guilty, Adam Hargraves and Daniel Stoten were found guilty by a Supreme Court jury of charges of conspiring to defraud a Commonwealth entity after defrauding the tax office of $2.2 million. They were sentenced to 6½ years jail.

However, Hargraves and Stoten's lawyers appealed both the conviction and sentence. The Court of Appeal dismissed both appeals against the convictions but the two men were resentenced, this time to five years jail replacing the original sentence of 6½ years.

Accountant Philip de Figueiredo was implicated in both the Hargraves case and the Wheatley case, and he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring with Wheatley to defraud the Commonwealth to cause a loss and two similar charges connected to the Hargraves and Stoten case on the Gold Coast where it was discovered de Figueiredo had set up a network of offshore companies to inflate the business expenses of Hargraves and Stoten.

An international arrest warrant was issued for Philip Egglishaw in 2013 after it was alleged he stole $34 million from Paul Hogan's Swiss bank account. Egglishaw denied the allegation, describing the accusations as 'completely false'. While attempting to leave Switzerland in May 2017, Egglishaw triggered a red notice, which drew attention to his wanted status and was subsequently arrested by Italian authorities.

Patricia Lindop

Patricia Joyce Lindop FRCP (21 June 1930 – 1 February 2018) was British professor of radiation biology at the University of London and the organiser of at least 100 "Pugwash" meetings at which scientists met to discuss their campaign for nuclear disarmament.

Patricia Lindop was born on 21 June 1930, the second child of Elliot D. Lindop and Dorothy Jones. Her father was an engineer who had worked for Shell in India and later owned his own fuel distribution business. She was educated at Malvern Girls' College in Worcestershire and it was there that she met her future husband, Gerald Paton Rivett Esdale (died 1992), who was a pupil at the neighbouring boys' college. They married in 1957 and had one son and one daughter.

Lindop was one of the first women to win a place to study medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College which had resisted accepting female students until forced to change its policy by the University of London. She received a first class degree. By 1954 she was working as a general practitioner and beginning to develop an interest in the effects of radiation on the human body. She started to work with the Polish physicist, and later Nobel Prize winner (1995), Joseph Rotblat at the University of London and they conducted experiments using thousands of mice to determine the effect of radiation on living organisms. Together they published 40 papers on the subject.

Later, Lindop became professor of radiation biology at St Bartholomew's but not before facing opposition to the appointment of a woman to the post.

Lindop organised at least 100 "Pugwash" conferences with Rotblat, who had worked on the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons during the Second World War but became vehemently opposed to them after seeing their effects on Japan. The Pugwash movement was a group of scientists who campaigned for nuclear disarmament and Lindop often held meetings of Pugwashites, as they are known, at her home in Hampstead, London.

She was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1977 (member, 1956). She was chairman of Thames Liquid Fuels (Holdings) Limited from 1992.

Lindop suffered a stroke at the age of 50 that restricted her movement and ability to speak, effectively ending her academic career. A more severe stroke in 1993 left her confined to a wheelchair and unable to move her mouth. She died on 1 February 2018.

<doc id="56565298" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56565298" title="Hans Joachim Meyer">
Hans Joachim Meyer

Hans Joachim Meyer (born 13 October 1936) is a German politician (CDU). He served in the as the last East German Minister for Education and the Arts. After reunification he became in the regional government of Saxony. In addition, he served between 1997 and 2009 as President of the Central Committee of German Catholics (""Zentralkomitee der deutschen Katholiken"" / ZdK).
Hans Joachim Meyer was born in Rostock. He grew up, after 1945, in the Soviet occupation zone which was relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). After successfully completing his school studies in Rostock he moved to the Berlin area. He attended the in Potsdam between 1955 and 1958 but was excluded after six terms before he could complete his degree because he "failed to connect with the working class" ("wegen "mangelnder Verbindung zur Arbeiterklasse""). The real issue, he later told an interviewer, was his commitment to the Catholic Church. His decision while still at school to join the CDU (political party) back in 1952, at a time when the ruling party was engaged in a robust campaign to take control of rival political parties, will already have drawn him to the attention of the authorities as a potential dissident in the making. For the next year he worked as an "assistant" at the VEB Lokomotivbau Potsdam-Babelsberg (factory) as the nearby rail-locomotive plant was known at that time. After that, resigning from the CDU in 1961, he was able to restart his university studies, now embarking on a course at the Humboldt University of Berlin of English and American Studies and Philology. His decision to select a subject that was seen by the authorities as less directly political was vindicated, in that this time he was able to complete his course, emerging with his university degree in 1964. He remained at the Humboldt as a teacher and senior research assistant between 1964 and 1982. He received his doctorate in 1971. His dissertation was, again, resolutely non-political: it comprised a semantic analysis of the modern English verb prefix "Up" when compared to related prefixes in English and German (""Semantische Analyse der modernenglischen Verbalpartikel "up" im Vergleich zu verwandten englischen und deutschen Verbalpartikeln""). Ten years later his habilitation, received in 1981, could have opened the way to a lifelong university career, had "events" not intervened. He was assigned to the Foreign Languages section between 1973 and 1977, becoming deputy director for education and training. Between 1978 and 1990 he headed up the Intensive Languages Training section at the Humboldt. He also held an appointment as Professor of Applied Linguistics between 1985 and 1990.

During his academic career in East Berlin Meyer was engaged with the church. Between 1973 and 1975 he served as a member of the Dresden Pastoral Synod of the region covered by the German Democratic Republic. Between 1976 and 1982 he worked with the Pastoral Council for the Bishopric in respect of East Berlin.

During the later 1980s the winds of Perestroika blowing cross from, of all places, Moscow, found a growing resonance on the streets in the German Democratic Republic, (even if the government was appalled). In November 1989 street protestors broke through the Berlin Wall, and it quickly became apparent that Fraternal Forces from the east had received no orders to intervene militarily. There would be no repeat of 1953 or of the tragedy of 1968 in Prague. A seemingly unstoppable series of events now unfolded leading to the country's first (and, as matters turned out, last) free and fair election. In previous general elections, turn-pout had always been recorded at around 99% of eligible voters and the proportion of votes cast for the ruling Socialist Unity Party had always been recorded at around 99% of votes cast. However, results in March 1990 indicated significant levels of support for various political parties, with the CDU and its centre-right allies winning 48% of the votes. Shorty after that Meyer received and accepted an invitation to join the new government headed up by Lothar de Maizière, despite not being at this stage a member of any political party, and despite not having stood for election to the national parliament (""Volkskammer""). Between 12 April and 3 October 1990 Meyer served as the German Democratic Republic's last Minister for Minister for Education and the Arts. His responsibilities included participation as leader of the East German delegation at the between May and September 1990. The commission was mandated to adapt an education system that would be implemented across a unified Germany. The commission's output was summarized in the Reunification Treaty (Articles 37 & 38) which came into force in October 1990 and was then implemented both at government level and on the ground.

In August 1990 the East German CDU (party) formally merged back into the West German CDU from which it had been forcibly separated by the post-war division of Germany, and Hans Joachim Meyer took the opportunity to rejoined the party from which, out of "disappointment over the party's limited political options" he had resigned in 1961. Directly following reunification he joined the regional government of Kurt Biedenkopf in Saxony, serving between November 1990 and May 2002 as .

T. K. V. Desikachar

Tirumalai Krishnamacharya Venkata Desikachar (21 June 1938 – 8 August 2016), better known as T. K. V. Desikachar, was a modern-day yoga teacher, whose father was the Indian yoga teacher, Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. In the West, there are several significant contemporary approaches to Hatha-Yoga, which are based on traditional teachings to varying degrees and which also utilize Yoga’s therapeutic potential. The most traditional orientation, which goes by the name of Viniyoga, is found in the school of Tirumalai Krishnamacharya (1888-1989) and his son T. K. V. Desikachar.

Desikachar was born in Mysore and moved to Madras (now Chennai) in the early 1960s. He had trained as an engineer, but, inspired by his father's teachings, he abandoned his engineering career and became a student of his father in 1960 even though it was at a time when the practice of yoga didn't have the respect it enjoys today. From the 1970s onwards he taught extensively in many parts of the world and published many books which became best sellers, with the result that his name and teachings became known worldwide. 

Desikachar is known for his incomparable ability to demystify yoga teachings and also for his pioneering work in the area of wellness and yoga therapy. During his intensive thirty years of study with his teacher, he learned the practice and application of all the tools of Yoga, including chanting, so as to be able to help people therapeutically, live their everyday life better and more productively, and evolve spiritually. He also studied in depth many literary works including the Vishnu Sahsranama, Bhagavad Gita, Visnu Purana, hymns of the great Vaisnavite saint Vedanta Desika, the Yoga Rahasya of Nathamuni, Patanjali's Yogasutra, Yajnavalkya Samhita, Yoga Taravalli, HathayogaPradipika. This long period of study is why Desikachar’s teaching so closely represents the complete tradition of his father...

Drawing on his father's teachings, Desikachar went on to develop Viniyoga , a term from the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. This highly individualised approach tailors the practice to each student's specific physical and mental condition, emotional state, age, cultural background, and interests. It is completely holistic, with all practice aspects completely aligned with the theory of yoga, especially of Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras.

In 1976 TKV Desikachar founded the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram (KYM), a yoga therapy clinic and yoga center in Madras, India, as a non-profit public charitable trust, teaching yoga inside India. Under Desikachar’s leadership, the KYM offered teacher training and individual instruction in asana, pranayama, meditation, yoga philosophy, and Vedic chanting, as well as pioneering research into the impact of yoga on people suffering from schizophrenia, diabetes, asthma, and depression. KYM also has the SIRO (Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) recognition awarded by the Department for Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India. The institution is a public registered charity, identified by the Department of Family Health and Welfare, by the Government of Tamil Nadu.

Because the KYM had been primarily set up with legal and statutory provisions to operate only within India, barring it from any activity outside India, TKV Desikachar and his son & student, Dr. Kausthub Desikachar, in 2006 founded the Krishnamacharya Healing and Yoga Foundation (KHYF), a partnership firm located in India.This was done to spread the teachings of Viniyoga® globally, as the tradition by then had many international students all over the world. The Krishnamacharya Healing & Yoga Foundation (KHYF) currently claims to be the worldwide headquarters, the anchor and official umbrella organisation representing the Viniyoga® tradition of Professor T Krishnamacharya and Desikachar globally. The KHYF also has copyrighted Viniyoga® in India and European Union. 

His wife, Menaka Desikachar, teaches yoga and Vedic chanting at KHYF. Bushan Desikachar, Dr. Kausthub Desikachar and Mekhala Desikachar are his three children. Dr. Kausthub Desikachar is also the Chief Executive and a senior teacher and yoga therapy consultant at KHYF. He was earlier also the Executive Trustree of the Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram till 2012. TKV Desikachar was one of the founders and directors of the institute. In 2012, Kausthub Desikachar stepped down from Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram and the Krishnamacharya Healing and Yoga Foundation after sexual misconduct allegations.These allegations were dropped by the authorities in 2014 and all accusations were cleared.

Desikachar died on 08 August 2016 in Chennai, India at the age of 78.

Integral bridge

An integral bridge contains no expansion joints to accommodate enlargement due to increased temperature. Horizontal (axial) movements due to thermal expansion and braking loads are instead transferred to the fill adjacent to the abutment. The omission of the expansion joint removes a pathway for the penetration of chloride-bearing road salts to the bridge's sub-structure. In the United Kingdom there is a presumption that most new short to medium length bridges will be of the integral type.

An early example of an integral bridge is masonry arch bridge. Some of the earliest examples of integral bridges in reinforced concrete were constructed as part of the United Kingdom's M1 motorway in 1959. 

An integral bridge contains no expansion joints, spanning monolithically from abutment to abutment. Movement due to thermal expansion and contraction or braking loads is accommodated by the end walls or abutments. Where intermediate supports are specified (eg. bridge piers) these may also serve to resist thermal expansion movements.

The omission of the expansion joint removes a significant maintenance and durability issue, as it serves as a point of ingress for road salts which allows the abutment, piers and deck soffit concrete to come under chloride attack that can cause degradation and eventual span failure. A 1989 British study showed that the majority of expansion joints surveyed in existing bridges had failed and allowed water (and hence salt) ingress.

The movement experienced at the abutment in an integral bridge is an order of magnitude greater than those designed with movement joints. The size of movement depends on the stiffness of the bridge structure and the fill adjacent to the abutment (which is subject to compaction). The movement is largest in the upper portion of the abutment, where thermal effects are greatest. Highways England specify that integral bridges should be designed to limit movement to . Due to repeated expansion and contraction cycles the backfill adjacent to the abutment is subject to ratcheting, whereby the material's stiffness is increased. The maximum stiffness level is reached after around 100–200 thermal expansion cycles.

Highways England recognises four types of integral bridge, defined by the construction of their abutments:

Where bridge bearings are used on an integral bridge (as is often the case for end screen abutment types) the structure is sometimes referred to as semi-integral.

It is widely accepted that short to medium length bridges should be designed as integral structures to minimise maintenance requirements. Highways England's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (applicable to the whole of the UK and many parts of it, including the section on integral bridges, applying to the Republic of Ireland) states that all bridges with deck length less than and skew of less than 30 degrees should be designed as integral structures unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise.

Lyulya kebab

Lyulya kebab or Lule kebab () is a type of kebab cooked on steel skewers. It is made from minced meat. As it looks like a weapon muzzle, it’s called “lülə” which means muzzle in Azerbaijani. It is considered to be a national dish type of Azerbaijani cuisine. It is mainly eaten in Caucasia, the Middle East, and Central Asia.


The soft portion of the mutton is ground with onion using a meat grinder and mixed with pepper and salt. There should be 400 grams of onion in per 1 kilogram of minced meat. This ratio is followed, to make it stay on the skewer. The meat mash is mixed well and stored in a cold for an hour. Later the mince is extracted from the refrigerator and is mixed well. The mince is wrapped around the skewer. The mince gets slightly long form on a slightly wide skewer. Then it gets fried on coal barbecue, called a mangal. It’s cooked for 10-15 minutes. The kebab is served between the lavash. Pouring sumac on it is optional.

Granada Street

Granada Street, also known as Senator Jose O. Vera Street, is a road in Quezon City, Metro Manila, the Philippines. It runs from Nicanor Domingo Street as an extension of Gilmore Avenue to the border with San Juan City, where it terminates at Col. Bonny Serrano Avenue and becomes Ortigas Avenue. 

The land on which the street lies on used to be part of an estate owned by the family of Jose O. Vera, founder of Sampaguita Pictures and later Senator from 1946 to 1949. In the late 1950s, Mayor Norberto Amoranto convinced the Vera family to permit construction of the street through their property, part of a project to improve connectivity between Quezon City — at the time the capital of the Philippines — and the surrounding suburbs, particularly those headed to New Manila from Mandaluyong and Pasig. The family sold one hectare of land to the Quezon City government at a significant discount to facilitate construction of the road, and its completion enabled direct access to Quezon City from eastern Metro Manila without needing to go through side streets or Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. In 2004, the street was renamed after Vera by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Quezon City.

Today, Granada Street is known for being home to several "parol" (Christmas lantern) vendors which line both sides of the street, giving it the name "Parol Row". Also known as the "Parolan sa San Juan" ("Lantern Area on the San Juan"), selling lanterns here began in the 1990s, when Sampaguita Pictures crewmen made lanterns and sold them outside the studio premises to generate extra income. Several vendors sell their lanterns here from September to December every year, with some selling the rest of the year as well. The street is also a culinary destination, having held this distinction since the 1970s. Modern-day dining establishments along the street include Gavino's Donuts, known for their Japanese-style donuts, and Mien-San, known for their Chinese-style steamed brisket and other dishes.

The KTM 790 Duke is a naked parallel-twin motorcycle, manufactured by KTM from 2017. The Duke's liquid cooled eight-valve DOHC engine uses a 285° crankshaft in order to mimic KTM's 75° V-Twins. Its power output is 105 bhp.

The Duke is KTM's first parallel-twin bike; previously the factory had produced only singles and V-twins. Released in 2018 for the European market, KTM propose to release the Duke as a 2019 model to the US market in late 2018. 

The Duke is also the first middleweight naked with an inertial measurement unit within its electronics that include ride-by-wire, fuel modes, and multi-level traction control. With a kerb weight of only 169 kg, the pared-down design is said to make the Duke the lightest bike in the middleweight naked market. KTM cooperated with Maxxis to develop special tyres for the Duke.

The KTM Duke has received positive reviews. 

In Motor Cycle News, senior bike tester Michael Nieves wrote that the KTM "manages to combine the best bits of its rivals", with "the speed and electronic sophistication of the Triumph Street Triple R, the punch and simplicity of the MT-07 and the cheekiness of the MT-09 ... with a dash of crazy 1290 Super Duke R". Nieves praises the KTM's riding position and comfort, but points out that wind protection is non-existent. His overall verdict: "Its engine is a peach, the chassis balanced and it's topped off with superbike-spec electronics".

Corrachomera () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation is Currach-Humra.

Corrachomera is bounded on the north by Owencam and Tullywaum townlands, on the west by Tullyveela and Tullynaconspod townlands, on the south by Cartronnagilta and Greaghnadoony townlands and on the east by Corlough townland, Leitra, Corlough and Tullytrasna townlands. Its chief geographical features are mountain streams, forestry plantations, gravel pits, dug wells and spring wells. Corrachomera is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 337 statute acres.

In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.

A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Curraghcombera or Curcanderry (The Marsh of the Oakwood)" and the owners as "John Finlay" and "George Finlay" and the previous owner as "Colonel Ennery deceased".

The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list one hundred and eighty five tithepayers in the townland.

The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The townland is bounded on the S. side by a large mountain stream".

In 1841 the population of the townland was 138, being 62 males and 76 females. There were twenty-six houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.

In 1851 the population of the townland was 122, being 64 males and 58 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were twenty-two houses in the townland, two of which were uninhabited.

Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists thirty eight landholders in the townland.

In 1861 the population of the townland was 118, being 54 males and 64 females. There were twenty-two houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.

In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twenty seven families listed in the townland.

In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are twenty seven families listed in the townland.

Victoria Nixon

Victoria Nixon (born 7 June 1948) is a British author and company director. She was previously an international fashion model.

Nixon was born in Barnsley, South Yorkshire and educated at Barnsley Girls' High School. Her father owned a car dealership; her mother was a college bursar. She had on elder brother. At the age of 16, she caught the eye of Paul Jones, the lead singer of Manfred Mann, at a gig in Sheffield, and he said that she should go to London to be a model. After completing a secretarial course at the Northern Secretarial College in Leeds, she left for London.

At the age of 18, she was spotted in London's Bond Street by top fashion photographer Helmut Newton who stepped out of a taxi and offered her a contract launching a decade-long international modelling career as Vikki Nixon in 1966. Subsequently she appeared in French, English, Italian and American "Vogue", "Harpers Bazaar", "Glamour", "Nova", "19" and "Elle".
She was selected as the Daily Mail's 'Face of 68', Jean Rook described her as "the grown up face of '68" and someone who would "set fire to the pages of the glossy magazines in the New Year."

She featured in a number of high profile press advertising campaigns and was the first British model to work with a Milan model agency, .

As a result of her modelling career she also appeared on a number of TV programmes, most notably in the 1969 live coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing where she appeared with presenter Cliff Michelmore and journalist Jean Rook during the live studio broadcast wearing a "space-fashion outfit". She was the first "promo star" of the BBC's 'Top of the Pops' described in Disc and Music Echo April 11th issue as an "Angelic looking Hell's Angel", and "girlfriend of promotion ace Bill Fowler." When a music act, such as Andy Williams or Kenny Rogers, was unable to appear live, producer/director Mel Cornish would pre-film a clip of her to broadcast with the song. She was featured in a 1975 version of the hugely successful and long running TV campaign for Cadbury's flake.

After modelling, Nixon relocated to Australia and became an advertising copywriter and was the Melbourne editor of POL magazine, an avant-garde fashion and lifestyle glossy, from 1978-85. Whilst still in Australia she formed a film production company and produced 'The Price of Fame' television series for Central Television UK, however the series was never broadcast but it remains "in the can".

In 1992, Nixon opened the One Stop Fresh delicatessen in Fulham, South London which specialised in healthy lunchtime food. One Stop Fresh was the first deli in the UK to use eco-friendly packaging.

In 2006, with Michael Messenger, she co-founded the British company Aircell Structures Ltd which designs and manufactures unique humanitarian aid products for medical charities and aid agencies such as IFRC, British & German Red Cross, Marie Stopes International and Vision Salud.

Whilst running the deli her first book 'Supermodels' Beauty Secrets was published in 2002 with contributions from Jerry Hall, Kate Moss and many others leading models. Reprinted thirteen times, it has also been translated into several languages including Spanish, Hungarian and Latvian. It formed part of Victoria's Celebrity Inspiration in "Beauty Flash", Liz Dwyer (now at "Image Magazine")'s weekly column in TV Now.

Nixon's follow-up book "Supermodels' Diet Secrets", based on her experience both as a model and latterly as a deli owner, was published in 2004 and the Daily Express bought the rights to serialise it. Tom Parker Bowles described it as "Chic Eating" in his "Food for Thought" column in the Daily Mail's Night&Day magazine

Frank Lugard Brayne

Frank Lugard Brayne (6 January 1882 – 3 April 1952) was an administrator in the Indian Civil Service (ICS) during the British Raj era. A nephew of Lord Lugard, who was zealous in his attempts to improve what he considered to be a "backward" Africa, Brayne had a similar evangelical outlook and was considered to be a maverick in the ICS. He attracted the opprobrium of both his colleagues and Indian people themselves in his attempts to improve the life of villagers in the Punjab Province of India.

Frank Lugard Brayne was born on 6 January 1882. A son of the Reverend R. T. W. Brayne, he attended Monkton Combe School before being admitted to Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he held a scholarship.

Brayne passed the competitive examination for appointment to the ICS in 1905. He was sent to the Punjab, where he worked for some time as secretary to Delhi Municipality during the period when the planning of New Delhi was underway. During World War I, he served with the 18th Lancers of the British Indian Army, being mostly based in the Middle East. He was appointed a Temporary Lieutenant in June 1915, and the Kingdom of Serbia awarded him the Order of St. Sava, fifth class, in 1917.

He was awarded the Military Cross in 1919 while serving as a Temporary Lieutenant in Egypt. The citation for that award was: 

After the war, Brayne returned to the Punjab and in 1920 he married Iris Goodeve, a daughter of Edgar Goble. He became district officer of Gurgaon, some from Delhi, at a time when the area, comprising a population of around 700,000, was suffering greatly from a recent influenza epidemic, a failed monsoon and the return of soldiers from the war. To counter the deprivation, Brayne initiated what became known as the Gurgaon Scheme, in which he hoped to alleviate the plight of peasants in all its aspects by encouraging and facilitating the idea of self-help. He wrote several books about this, including "Village Uplift in India", "Socrates in an Indian Village", "Socrates Persists in India", and "Socrates at School", as well as one comparing rural life in India with that of England. The scheme was not a success. 

Clive Dewey argued, in his book "Anglo-Indian Attitudes: The Mind of the Indian Civil Service", that Brayne's approach to rural uplift was bound to fail, because Indian peasants did not share Brayne's evangelical values - not least his belief that poverty-stricken cultivators in famine-stricken areas could revolutionise their standard of living by working harder and practising thrift, without any assistance from the state. His conclusions, which were supported by years of research in Indian archives and by extensive interviews with Brayne's contemporaries, were accepted by several members of the ICS and have been endorsed by subsequent historians. Philip Mason, himself a former member of the ICS, and the author of the most famous history of the service, described Brayne as being More recently, Atiyab Sultan said that Brayne's interventionism had a "missionary zeal" and that his methods were "more prescriptive" than those of Malcolm Lyall Darling, who was another somewhat maverick British administrator in Punjab.

One of Brayne's sons, Thomas Lugard Brayne, became embroiled in a controversy in "The Times Literary Supplement" and the "Telegraph" following the publication of Dewey's book in 1993. He believed that Dewey had seriously misrepresented his father, unreasonably portrayed the character of the ICS itself, and misled the Brayne family, whose collection of private papers he used. In his rejoinders, Dewey pointed out that when he asked for permission to use Brayne's papers, he believed that Brayne's Gurgaon Experiment had been a success, because he only had Brayne's vainglorious accounts of his own achievements to go on; and he only lost confidence in Brayne's form of "rural reconstruction" after the overwhelming mass of evidence showed how dismally it had failed. It was impossible, he maintained, to take Brayne at his own valuation. Brayne boasted that he could 'do anything with propaganda' - and propaganda is what his work remained. At best, it raised the official awareness of the problems of the peasantry, without providing effective solutions.

By 1937, Brayne was Commissioner for Rural Reconstruction in the Punjab and in 1940 he was Financial Commissioner (Development) there. In December 1941, he was appointed as a 2nd Lieutenant, having retired from the ICS to become welfare officer and then Commissioner for Resettlement of Soldiers in Punjab.

Brayne returned to England prior to Indian independence. He settled at The Glebe, a farm in Ashill, Norfolk, where he attempted to apply his theories of agriculture to an area of . He died on 3 April 1952 at The Glebe, at which time his military rank was stated as being Colonel. He was survived by his wife, four sons and two daughters.

Aside from being awarded the Military Cross, Brayne was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire in 1941, having being made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1937. He also held the Volunteer Decoration. His wife, Iris Goodeve Brayne, had been awarded the Kaiser-i-Hind Medal in 1928.

River Ledge Historic District

The River Ledge Historic District is a primarily residential historic district located along Jefferson, Scott, and Lincoln Streets between Franklin and Maple Streets in Grand Ledge, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.

The Grand Ledge area was first settled in the 1840s. In 1849, a dam and sawmill were constructed across the Grand River at the site, and in 1850 the first commercial establishment in the town opened. In 1853, the first portion of the new settlement was platted; by 1860 about 225 people lived in Grand Ledge. It was about this time that development in the River Ledge Historic District began, as Jefferson became one of the most prestigious streets to live on. In 1869, the Ionia and Lansing Railroad was constructed through Grand Ledge, bringing a trade catering to visitors, as well as a new manufacturing base, to Grand Ledge. Along with the new prosperity came accelerated development in the district, as well-to-do local businessmen and manufacturers began constructing houses.

Some of the earliest residents of the district include Edmund Lamson, the founder of Grand Ledge and the first village president; Frank D. Fitzgerald, Governor of Michigan from 1936 to 1939; Edward A. Turnbull, owner of the Grand Ledge Chair Company; hardware dealers Hillard J. Babcock and Sylvester B. Granger; grocer George Coryell; building contractor Elmer Edwards; and doctors Abraham DeGroff and Andrew G. Stanka.

Gtowth in the district continued to accelerate through the nineteenth century, with the period of most growth occurring between about 1895 and 1920. Development began to slow then, with the last historically significant structure in the district, the public library, constructed in 1931.

The River Ledge Historic District contains 282 buildings, of which 235 contribute to the historic nature of the district. All but eight of the buildings were constructed as housing, and nearly all of the houses are single family residences. The structures in the district date from the 1850s to the 1920s, and include a broad range of architectural styles, including Greek Revival and Gothic Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, Colonial Revival, and Bungalow/craftsman. The district contains the hares of many prominent citizens of early Grand Ledge, as well as several historic civic and church buildings.

Some of the significant structures in the district include:

Bishopsgate House is a large house in Englefield Green, Egham, Surrey, England. Its 42-acre estate lies close to one of the entrances to Windsor Great Park. It was built immediately to the south of the old Bishops Gate House that was demolished in the twentieth century.

In 1863, Bishops Gate House was home to Charles Joyce, a member of the Royal Agricultural Society of England, and in 1872, a four and a half year lease (then renewable yearly) was granted to Richard James Ashton.

During the Second World War, the house was the headquarters of 4 Wireless Group of the Royal Corps of Signals, who occupied a number of large country houses in the Egham area.

Bishopsgate House was built in the later twentieth century and is "one of several British homes" of the Saudi billionaire Walid Juffali and his second wife Christina Estrada, until his death in July 2016, who acquired it from his parents in about 2001. There were "three butlers, six gardeners, five maids, two laundry girls, two drivers, two personal assistants, two nannies and an estate manager on the staff". Juffali's art collection, estimated at £4 million, which includes art installations and sculpture in the garden and fittings from the house, will be auctioned onsite by Bonham's on 26 March 2018.

Life of Sir William Petty 1623 - 1687

The Life of Sir William Petty 1623-1687 is a book, written by Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice, and published in 1895. It is a biography of Sir William Petty, the 17th-century scientist, known for his inventions, his charting of large parts of Ireland, in the Down Survey, and his publications on many different topics, like "political arithmetic" and political economy.

335 p.

Fitzmaurice founded his biography of Sir William Petty largely on the manuscripts in the so-called 'Bowood' papers. The papers originally belonging tot Sir Willliam Petty passed to his grandson, John Petty, 1st Earl of Shelburne (1706-1761), who bought Bowood House in Wiltshire, England in 1754.

The letters written by Sir William Petty to Sir Robert Southwell (1635-1702) were later added to the Bowood papers by the 3rd Marquis of Lansdowne.

Apart from the Bowood papers, Fitzmaurice also studied manuscripts in the British Museum, in the Bodleian Library and in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin.

Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice (1846-1935), also named Edmond George Petty-Fitzmaurice, was a descendant of Willliam Petty and a liberal politician. He also published a biography of his great-grandfather, William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne in 1912, biographies of Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville (in 1905) and of Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (in 1901), and some theatre plays.

The biography is chronological. In the first chapter the life of Petty up to 1652 is summarized. It ends with his application as surgery-general in Cromwell's Irish army.

In the second and third chapter, which cover a total of 80 pages, an extensive description is given of the Down Survey, the cadastral survey carried out by Petty in 1655 and 1656, and especially on the long aftermath of that survey. After the survey Petty was accused of fraud and bribery, and it took him years to clear his name.

The next chapters cover the period from 1660 to 1678, in which Petty published much of the works that, centuries later, brought him fame among economists and staticians. A separate, central chapter (Chapter 7) is devoted to his "Political Arithmetic" (and his opinions concerning political economy).

The last three chapters give an overview of the period from 1678 until Petty's death in 1687.

The "Life of Petty" was reviewed in different journals.

Heinrich Cunow wrote a review in Die Neue Zeit, 1896.
He was happy to see that a biography on William Petty had appeared: 'Finally, more than two hundred years after his death, the most genial of the English political economists of the seventeenth century has found his biographer', writes Cunow in his review in Die Neue Zeit in 1896. But, does he write subsequently, the (large amount of) work that is done by Fitzmaurice, does not provide a satisfactory result and does not offer a clear image of the character (of Petty). Questions like 'what where the influences that worked on Petty's intellectual development?' are not answered and only on very few places insight is given into the depth of Petty's ideas ('Ideenwelt'). Neither gives Fitzmaurice an account of the less attractive sides of Petty's character, like his ruthless addiction to profitmaking.

Cunow also makes some remarks concerning Bevan's "" (1894).

Charles Henry Hull wrote a review in "The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science" of 1896, together with a review of .
Hull finds a sharp distinction between the first six chapters (1623-1678) and the last chapters. In the first chapters Fitzmaurice "writes chiefly from sources already well known (…). . Relatively little that is new appears." Whereas the latter part of the book is largely based on (until then less known) Petty's correspondence with Sir Robert Southwell (1635-1702) and on several unprinted letters to Lady Petty.

William Ashley wrote a review in The American Historical Review,1895. He thought that a reader will profit of this book, full of information, and giving abundant menas of arriving at a fair estimate of Petty's character, "only in proportion to what he already knows of the period; and even those who have some tolerable acquaintance with the time will find themselves at a los to explain many of the allusions with which Petty's papers are bestrewn. The note on pages 296, 301,–"the allusion is not clear,"–might stand with equal propriety at the foot of many other pages."

Arcs of Descent and Ascent

The Arcs of Descent and Ascent, an ontological circle, are described in Neoplatonism, Islamic and Sufi cosmology, mainly inspired by the works of Ibn al-Arabi. In the Arc of Descent ("qaws al-nuzuli"), from unity to diversity, God creates successively the Intellect (Supreme Pen), the Universal Soul (Guarded Tablet), Prime Matter, Nature, the Universal Body (including the imaginal world) and the Earth. The Arc of Ascent ("qaws al-su'ud") is the way back to the Presence of God, the process of spiritual perfection.

In a hadith attributed to Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam of Shi'i Islam, the arc of descent is described as having seven stages. These stages have been commented on in Shaykhism.

In the Bábí and Bahá'í Faiths the stages of the Arc of Descent are described as follows: Will (Mashiyyat), Determination (Iradih), Destiny (Qadar), Decree (Qada), Permission (Idhn), Term (Ajal), and Book (Kitab). Bahá'u'lláh's "Seven Valleys" is an example of the Arc of Ascent. In "Some Answered Questions" 'Abdu'l-Bahá states that "man is in the ultimate degree of materiality and the beginning of spirituality; that is, he is at the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection. He is at the furthermost degree of darkness and the beginning of the light. That is why the station of man is said to be the end of night and the beginning of day."

James Turnbull Thomson

James Turnbull Thomson (1810 – c. 20 August 1876) was a publican and brewer, recognised as the founder of Balhannah, South Australia.

Thomson was a son of Rev. James Thomson, pastor of Steeple Church, Dundee, and his wife Hannah Thomson, née Turnbull.

He emigrated to South Australia aboard "Georgiana", arriving in Adelaide in August 1839. Before leaving Scotland he purchased Section 4208 in the Mount Barker region.
Another reference has him purchasing the land from Hampden Dutton after arriving in the colony.

In 1840 Thomson was involved with Robert Cock and J. L. Crabb in a venture to sell lots of land in Balhannah, which Thomson named for his mother (and also his sister) Hannah, the prefix Bal being a Gaelic word meaning "place" or "town", as in Balnagowan and Balmoral. He built the Balhannah Inn, which he let to one S. Bartlett who left shortly after.
A year later he reopened the Inn, with himself as publican,
followed by James Anderson. In 1855 Thomson's application for a licence was refused, while Edward Morris's application for the Golden Cross Hotel (now the Balhannah Hotel) was granted, sparking a feud which culminated in Thomson's serving time in jail for slander.

He brewed his first beer at Balhannah in August 1843 with the assistance of W. Milne and W. Johnston, one of the brothers who later founded the Oakbank Brewery. In June 1844 he was obliged to mortgage his property and in 1855 had a second attempt at beer brewing.

He was several times in financial difficulties, on one occasion helped out by his father, who purchased his property, then mortgaged it to pay a debt to Alexander Cock.

His body was found in marsh land near the North Arm Road, Dry Creek. He never married and appeared to have no relations in South Australia, though one John Thomson (1794–1869), later of "Lilybank", Mount Pleasant, and family are known to have stayed in the Balhannah region during their first years in the colony.

William Aikenhead

William Aikenhead (7 May 1842 – 3 April 1902) was an Australian politician, who was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1898 until his death in office in 1902.

Aikenhead was born in Launceston. His father, James Aikenhead, was the founder, editor and proprietor of "The Examiner" newspaper, and later became a politician on the Tasmanian Legislative Council. In 1869, James Aikenhead transferred his editorship of "The Examiner" to his son, where he worked for ten years.

On 21 June 1898, Aikenhead stood as a candidate in a by-election for the electoral district of Devonport. He was elected, however one of the other candidates, John McCall, petitioned the Supreme Court of Tasmania that Aikenhead had engaged in bribery and "treating by agent"—Aikenhead's representative, Archibald Phillips, had promised electors a "go in" if he was elected, and the night after the election plied local hotels with free beer paid for by Aikenhead. The court found against Aikenhead, and declared his election void, although they did not declare McCall elected, and instead called another by-election. Aikenhead was disqualified from running for Devonport for two years, however when the member for Latrobe, Henry Murray, resigned to contest the Devonport by-election, Aikenhead nominated for the Latrobe vacancy and was elected.

Aikenhead was re-elected in the March 1900 general election, and continued to serve until his death in office on 3 April 1902. He was succeeded by Murray, who had been defeated in 1900, and returned to his old seat when elected unopposed in the by-election triggered by Aikenhead's death.

S-Net

S-Net is a worldwide inter-satellite communications network consisting of four satellites and being operated by the Technical University of Berlin.

The project has the goal to investigate and demonstrate inter-satellite communication technology within a distributed and autonomously operating nanosatellite network. All satellites are equipped with a S-Band radio emitter and receiver, which not only enables communication with the ground-based control center but also allows for communication between the individual satellites. The number of satellites in the network was set to four as this number represents the best cost-benefit-ratio. With four satellites, a total of six indipendent communication links are possible, while only three are possible with three satellites. Moreover, four is the lowest number that enables multi-hop communication.
The satellites are powered by solar cells and batteries and have a planned lifetime of one year. 
Future applications of the technology may be more effective monitoring of global issues like climate change, disaster management, maritime systems monitoring and even enable satellite constellations for high-bandwidth internet access.

The four satellites were successfully launched on a Soyuz-2.1A rocket from Vostochny Site 1S in Russia on 1 February 2018. The launch was originally scheduled for 22 December 2017, however due to the failure of a Soyuz-2.1B rocket, Roscosmos decided to delay the mission. The spacecrafts were released into orbit at an altitude of approximately 580 kilometers at an interval of 10 seconds. The launch represents the tenth mission of the TU Berlin, sending a total of 16 satellites to space.

Ignazio Florio Jr.

Ignazio Florio Jr. (Palermo, 1 September 1869 – Palermo, 19 September 1957) was an Italian entrepreneur, heir of the rich Florio economic dynasty, one of the wealthiest Italian families during the late 19th century.

He was the son of the Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, Ignazio Florio Sr. and baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona. When his father died in 1891, Ignazio Jr., at the of 22, inherited one of the greatest fortunes in Italy. The Florio business empire had far-reaching interests in sulphur, tuna fishing, Marsala wine, insurance and banking, and metallurgy (the "Oretea" foundry) and engineering. The Florio family was a major share holder in the "Navigazione Generale Italiana" (NGI), Italy's main shipping company at the time and one of the major one's in Europe. 

In 1893, like his father before him, he married a woman from the old Sicilian aristocracy, Francesca Paola Jacona della Motta dei baroni di San Giuliano, who would become known as the ""Queen of Palermo"", as she became a prominent protagonist of the Belle Époque in Palermo. He was the principal impresario of the Teatro Massimo, when the building was finished in 1897. He was also the main shareholder and financier of the Sicilian daily newspaper "L'Ora", founded in 1900 and published in Palermo.

In the heyday of its existence reportedly some 16,000 people depended on the Florio business empire, and the press sometimes referred to Palermo as 'Floriopolis'. However, as international competition increased and the economic importance was moving to the north of Italy, to the cities of Milan, Turin and Genoa, the family had to face an increasingly deteriorated economic reality resulting in bankruptcies and closures of activity. In 1897 he had founded the "Cantiere navale di Palermo" (Palermo Shipyard) to service the commercial fleet. Construction was protracted, however, and Florio was forced to sell his stake in the shipyard to Attilio Odero in 1905. He was also forced to sell the family's interests in NGI in 1908. The blockage of maritime and commercial activities caused by the First World War paralyzed the activities of the Florios.

The Florio empire began to fade. The shipping lines depended mainly on state subsidies; the beneficial effects of the Unification of Italy had disappeared and the size of the economic empire had made it increasingly difficult to be directly manage by Ignazio, without the interference of the banks and competitors in the north. The stagnation of the family businesses, despite the awareness of the imminent decline, resulted in huge debts and all the Florio companies either were sold or disappeared. Contrary to what the founder Vincenzo Florio Sr. had done in the first half of the nineteenth century, the later generations did not sufficiently diversify their interests in new markets and did not invest in the new technologies available at the beginning of the twentieth century. They were simply trying to maintain the already acquired market positions, without opening new and more profitable ones. 

Despite the increasing economic difficulties, the Florios maintained their expensive way of life. After the sale of Villa Florio all'Olvuzza in 1924, the family moved to Rome. Between 1925 and 1935 the economic collapse deprived Ignazio Junior of all his assets. In 1935 Donna Franca's jewels and their furniture and real estate were auctioned in Palermo. In spite of everything, the Florios never failed: Ignazio Florio jr did not escape his responsibilities, he sold all the companies and the whole family patrimony to pay his debts to the last penny, before retiring to private life. The last years of his life were marked by total apathy, deafness and complete loneliness except for the presence of his wife. After the death of the latter in 1950, he returned to Palermo where he died on 19 September 1957.

Ignazio Jr. and his wife Franca had five children:

<doc id="56566420" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56566420" title="Alfredo Cremonesi">
Alfredo Cremonesi

Alfredo Cremonesi (15 May 1902 — 7 February 1953) was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and member from the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions. He studied in Crema and Milan before setting off from Genoa to Naples and then to the Burmese missions via boat. He pledged that he would never return to the Italian mainland and spent the remainder of his life working with the Burmese people in mountain villages despite the great difficulties he faced. Cremonesi was also a prisoner of the Japanese during World War II after the Japanese occupied the nation.

The Burmese independence reached in 1948 prompted guerilla conflict which caused great unrest and destruction to the point that Cremonesi and other missionaries were forced into exile so as to remain safe. But he reached out to the guerillas and received their permission to return to the village he worked in. It was also there in that village that government forces mistook him for a rebel - or a supporter of the rebels - and shot him dead alongside the village chief and two girls.

The beatification process for the late priest opened in 2004 and he became titled as a Servant of God.

Alfredo Cremonesi was born on 15 May 1902 in Ripalta Guerina in Cremona as the first of seven children to the grocer Enrico Cremonesi and Maria Rosa Scartabellati. His siblings (in order) were:
He received his baptism on 16 May in the local parish church from Father Angelo Bassi. One cousin was Amina Uselli and a paternal aunt was the nun Sister Gemma (16 July 1878−3 April 1958). Cremonesi received his Confirmation on 4 October 1980 from the Bishop of Crema Ernesto Fontana and then made his First Communion on 1 April 1909. His father was a devoted Christian who opposed Fascism and it was his mother who oversaw the religious education of the seven children. It was in his childhood at some stage that he read the journal of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux and from that point fostered a deep devotion to her. His brother Ernesto was also a devoted Christian whom the Nazis arrested and jailed in a concentration camp where he would die in 1945 before the European Theatre conflict ended. Cremonesi sent a letter to his parents upon learning this and said that "I am proud to be his brother" and that "Ernesto will be able to do more in paradise than he could have done on earth".

His time in school was interrupted due to a severe disease and he was forced to spend most of that time confined to his bed. His frail health since childhood led to people concluding that he would never be able to enter the missions since it would be improbable that he would be cured of his consistent ailments. The desire to enter the missions had been a dream he had for sometime since his late childhood and into his adolescence. But he defied the odds (and the expectation of doctors who thought he would die in a few months) and overcame his disease with Cremonesi attributing his healing to Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. Upon his recuperation he transferred to Milan for education in an institute that the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions managed to prepare new missionaries on 17 September 1922. He became known for being both impetuous and a gifted writer who published a collection of poems.

Between October and November 1923 he received the minor orders before being elevated into the subdiaconate on 19 April 1924 and the diaconate on 29 June 1924. The seminarian received his ordination to the priesthood in October 1924 (from the P.I.M.E. bishop Giovanni Menicatti in the San Francesco Saverio church) and then in June 1925 learned that his dream to enter the missions was to take place for he would be sent to the then-Burma. Cremonesi received a special dispensation for his ordination since he had not reached the canonical age required for ordination. Cremonesi celebrated his first Mass on 19 October 1924 in San Michele and on 5 October 1925 received the cross of the missions from the Archbishop of Milan Eugenio Tosi. But before being sent to the missions he was put in charge of teaching the Italian language in the Seminario Minore di San Ilario in Nervi in Genoa. He left Genoa for Naples and set sail from there on 16 October 1925 but before leaving declared he would never return to his homeland despite the insistence of his relatives to return for a visit. His mother did not take well to his desire for the missions but relented to her son's wishes and maintained correspondence with him on a frequent basis. Cremonesi celebrated his last Mass before leaving in Crema in the Santuario della Madonna delle Grazie on 4 October 1925.

But his new mission also proved difficult for the enthusiastic Cremonesi who suffered from loneliness for a brief time upon his arrival on 10 November 1925. He worked with the Karen people in an isolated mountain village and often had to travel miles between communities to visit the people. His first assignment was in Yedashé in western Yoma to visit villages and he was successful in the conversion of some of the natives. He was later transferred to Donokù and would remain there until the outbreak of World War II in relative peace. Cremonesi was often exhausted from his extensive trips and he even once contracted malaria. During the 1920s he maintained correspondence with the P.I.M.E. superior Blessed Paolo Manna and met with Manna when he visited the Burmese missions on 19 February 1928.

The outbreak of World War II saw the British-run Burma enter the conflict to the detriment of Italian missionaries who soon found themselves as enemies due to Benito Mussolini declaring his alliance with the Axis powers. To that end he was moved further north to Moshò to work in the villages. Near the end of the war he was forced to live in the forest where he ate herbs in order to survive. Cremonesi wrote of the trials he endured during the war in a letter dated on 20 February 1946; he refers to his lack of food and clothing (limited to what he had on) and noting that villages were devoid of people with marketplaces being abandoned.

In 1941 he avoided Japanese imprisonment in a concentration camp in India after the Japanese occupied the nation. He lived eating herbs cooked in salt and water during this time but was discovered and caught. In the final month of the war a Japanese officer took him and tied him up for the night before allowing him to leave in the morning where he took refuge in the woods. Cremonesi did not understand the reason for his release but attributed it to the intercession of God.

Cremonesi fostered a great devotion to Saint Thérèse of Lisieux and to the Sacred Heart. He practiced Eucharistic Adoration each night for one hour before the tabernacle and awoke around 4:00am in the morning to celebrate Mass.

He returned to Donokù after the war had ended to resume his work. But Burmese independence from the British Empire in 1948 prompted conflict once the Karen people rebelled and started to resort to use guerilla tactics against the new government. This conflict would endure even after Cremonesi's later murder. In August 1950 the rebels attacked the village prompting both Cremonesi and the inhabitants to flee into the forest before he took refuge close o the mission in Taungngu. Cremonesi was saddened that these occurrences had taken place and he referred to his current state as an exile. On 25 March 1952 he was permitted to return to the village where he was able to resume his work after he made contact with the guerillas who allowed him to return to the village. Cremonesi knew of Clemente Vismara and wrote of him in high esteem.

The rebels defeated government soldiers - on 7 February 1953 - which prompted the surviving government forces to flee to the village that Cremonesi was stationed in. But the soldiers soon became convinced upon their entrance that the villagers favored the rebels and were perhaps allies to the rebels. This presented a clear danger to the villagers which prompted Cremonesi to intervene to assure them that there were no rebels nor rebel allies present in the village. This convinced the soldiers who left the village in peace. But the rebels ambushed the soldiers just outside the village which prompted the soldiers to return in anger to seek out Cremonesi believing it had been a set up. The soldiers even perceived his clothing to be alike to that of the rebels. Cremonesi's words went ignored and the soldiers fired their machine guns at him and the village chief who both collapsed to the ground (the village chief died while Cremonesi was still alive after being shot in the chest). Two girls were behind them and were killed in that attack. The villagers fled into the forest during the commotion while the soldiers entered the local church and desecrated it before setting the village ablaze. Once this was done the commander approached the injured Cremonesi and shot him in the face at point-blank range when he realized the priest was still alive.

The villagers returned to the remains of their village on 8 February to collect and inter the dead which included Cremonesi (while also washing his remains). But the villagers - before his burial - cut some parts of his beard and bloodied shirt and sent it to P.I.M.E. authorities in Taungngu in an envelope with an inscription: "Relics of the martyr Father Cremonesi to be sent to his parents". On 7 May 1953 a P.I.M.E. priest visited Donokù for the identification of his remains which were exhumed for a solemn funeral and burial in Taungngu. His death was announced in Crema in the diocesan paper "Il nuovo Torrazzo" on 14 February 1953 in a piece entitled "Abbiamo un martire".

The beatification process opened on 29 March 2004 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled the late priest as a Servant of God and issued an edict that declared "nihil obstat" (no objections to the cause). The forum for the process was transferred on 4 March 2004 from Taungngu to both the Cremona diocese and the Taunggyi archdiocese. The diocesan process of investigation was opened in 2004 and concluded on 9 June 2004 in the two dioceses with their respective heads (Bishop Dante Lafranconi and Matthias U Shwe) overseeing the process. The C.C.S. issued a decree on 9 February 2007 that made the diocesan investigation valid while historical consultants to the C.C.S. approved Cremonesi's cause on 13 May 2014.

The postulation drafted and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 2015 for evaluation while nine theologians confirmed the cause in their meeting held on 6 February 2018. It has been confirmed from some officials close to the cause in Cremona that the beatification - if and when approved - would be celebrated in Cremona.

The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Francesca Consolini.

Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute

The Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute (CNMI) () is a medical institute of the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University in Thailand. It was built in commemoration of King Bhumibol Adulyadej's 7th cycle (84th) birthday anniversary on the 5th of December 2011 to increase the outreach of medical services in Samut Prakan Province and neighbouring provinces as well as increasing opportunities for the medical treatment in the locality.

The Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute was initiated from King Bhumibol's royal address regarding the construction of a medical facility for both treatment and education in the Samut Prakan Area. This is to increase the number of healthcare services provided for local residents, as most citizens in the area work in the secondary sector in factories and industrial plants. It would also provide medical services for provinces in the eastern region of Thailand including: Chonburi Province, Rayong Province, Chanthaburi Province, Trat Province, Chachoengsao Province, Prachinburi Province and Sa Kaeo Province. Furthermore, most of the hospitals located in Samut Prakan are of the private sector, thus people with low incomes may find it difficult to fund their treatment at these hospitals.

The Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute opened on 25 December 2017 by Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn.

The initial project details of the Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute is outlined in 2011 under the "Ramathibodi towards Leading Medical School in Asia (Ramathibodi-Bang Phli)" project and is as follows:

Around Brazil is a solo piano album by Simon Nabatov. It was recorded in 2005 and released by ACT Music.

The album of solo piano performances by Nabatov was recorded in September 2005. All of the tracks were recorded at the Rainbow Studio in Oslo, except for "Partita de Março", which was recorded in Cologne. The album was produced by Siegfried Loch.

Nabatov plays prepared piano on "Depois que o Ilê passar". "Valsa de Pôrto Das Caixas" is a delicate waltz by Antônio Carlos Jobim. On "Partita de Março", the formal theme gradually emerges, "almost like the sculptor finding the form that is already present in the uncut stone." It quotes Jobim's "Waters of March" and Bach.

"Around Brazil" was released in Germany by ACT Music on 26 May 2006. It was the fifth in their Piano Works series. "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" described it as "a quite extraordinary essay in modern pianism [...] he takes each piece out into areas of creative improvisation that no one else would have thought of". They also highlighted the extreme separation of bass and treble in the recording. The MusicWeb reviewer wrote that, "If you care about good jazz – or good music of any kind – you need to buy this CD."

Archibald Cary Smith

Archibald Cary Smith (September 4, 1837 – December 8, 1911), professionally known as A. Cary Smith, was a naval architect and marine engineer. He studied marine painting for a short time and did some art work. He is known as the first American to develop the concept of designing a yacht on paper using calculations and comparisons, a method of drafting that has been followed ever since for the construction of yachts and taught in many universities. He designed the first iron yacht in America. In his 55 year career he designed dozens of yachts.

Smith was born at New York City on September 4, 1837. He was named after Archibald Cary, an ancestor. Smith's parents were Rev. Dr. E. Dunlap Smith and Jane B. Cary Smith. He had several siblings. Smith's family came to New York City from Philadelphia. He was educated at the University Grammar School of New York City. Smith's paternal grandfather was an ironmaster and had gone to sea as a sailor, so inspired Smith of sailing. In New York City near his father’s church at a street corner was a community water pump. As a young boy, he and his companion friends would dam the streets and then pump water into them to make a small pond. They then would float a homemade craft on their street pond. This was his first experience as a naval architect. 

Smith lived near the yard where the yacht "America" was being built. He spent his time at the yard watching its construction. He then went home and reproduced her in small models he would make of the yacht. He had a strong desire to build boats so was allowed to go to Pamrapo in New Jersey under the tutoring of Captain Bob Fish, a professional yacht skipper. From him he learned the practical side of yacht building and sailing. He later took one term of naval architecture under W.W. Bates, who was a shipwright and later Commissioner of Navigation.

Smith built "Comment" early in his career in 1860. It was an 18-foot sloop which became famous that defeated all rivals for years. In time he became known as a skilled helmsman of yachts in New York. Later he abandoned yachts and took up marine painting under Mauritz de Haas for a short time. It was during this time he came up with ideas other than being an artist. Robert Center came to America from Europe in 1870 and sought Smith's aid in designing and building an iron yacht in America based on the design of the English cutter "Mosquito." Center had with him a copy of Marrett's English book on how to design a yacht using a drawing on paper. Smith then studied the book and designed in 1870 the cutter "Vindex" that was built for Center. It was built by Reaney, Son & Archbold in Chester, Pennsylvania, on the Delaware River in 1871. It was the first American iron yacht. It was designed by Smith as a systematic drawing instead of using the old rule-o-thumb method of working off a wooden model as was done up to that time.

The experience designing the "Vindex" started Smith on his career of designing yachts on drawings using calculation, which is the method now used in all yacht construction. From that time on in his career he designed every class of yachts and schooners using systematic calculated drawings. The method has since been taught at Cornell University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Naval Academy at Annapolis, and the Webb Academy at New York. After a 55 year career as a naval designer, Smith died in New York City on December 8, 1911.

Smith as a naval architect and marine engineer designed several yachts and schooners. Among these were "Comment" (1860), "Prospero" (1873), "Intrepid" (1878), "Mischief" (1879), "Norma" (1879), "Fortuna" (1883), "Rajah" (1884), "Priscilla" (1885), "Cinderella" (1886), "Iroquois" (1886), "Banshee" (1887), "Yampa" (1887), "Gorilla" (1889), "Lasca" (1892), "Richard Peck" (1892), "Ariel" (1893), "City of Lowell" (1894), "Amorita" (1895), "Katrina" (1899), "Genesee" (1900), and "Elimina" (1905). He designed the Sound steamers "City of Lowell," "Chester W. Chapin," the "Refuge" and the "Free Lance." He also designed and built the iron yacht "Vindex."

Smith designed the schooner yacht "Meteor III" for the German Emperor in 1902, which came about from the previous yacht "Yampa". Smith had originally designed and built "Yampa" for Chester W. Chapin, which in time came into the hands of the emperor. The Kaiser desired to have an additional similar yacht as the Yampa, however bigger and faster, so contacted Smith to design one. This was "Meteor III."

Smith was associated with the Society of Naval Architects and Engineers. He was a board member of the Larchmont Yacht Club and New York Yacht Club. Smith was an active member of the Seawanhaka Yacht Club when it was renamed the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club in 1882. He gave lectures at the Club on how to design and construct yachts because of his extensive experience. Examples of his lectures were "How to Build a Yacht" and "Construction of Keel Yachts."

Kids Saving the Rainforest (KSTR) is a Costa Rica-based non-governmental non-profit 501 C3 organization founded in 1999 to plant trees in depleted areas of the country, and to rescue, rehabilitate and, when possible, release the animals who live in these forests. Since its inception, Kids Saving the Rainforest has planted or is in the process of planting nearly 100,000 trees and rescued and rehabilitated 3,000 wild animals, two-thirds of which have been released back into the wild.

KSTR's mission is: "to protect the diverse wildlife of Costa Rica’s Pacific Coast by rehabilitating wildlife, conducting original scientific research, training volunteers, and promoting conservation."

Kids Saving the Rainforest was founded in February 1999 by two nine-year old girls, Janine Licare and Aislin Livingstone, who were living in the jungle of Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica. The girls made paper-mache bottles and painted rocks and sold them by the side of the road to raise money for saplings that would be planted in the nearby forest.

Since then, KSTR has become a fully functional environmental organization with a board of directors. Licare's mother, Jennifer Rice is president. The staff includes a number of full-time people plus volunteers.

KSTR is located outside Manual Antonio, Costa Rica, but has projects in 18 countries.

KSTR rescues and rehabs animals that are brought to their facility. In addition, the ones that can not be released back into the wild are given sanctuary for life on the property. The goal is to release as many animals as possible. With an average of 200 rescues a year, over 75 species have been rescued at their center. This includes, among others, two- and three-toed sloths, squirrel monkeys, kinkajous, coatis, marmosets, tamarins, orange-chinned parakeets.

KSTR started a Wildlife Bridge Program in 2000, originally to protect the endangered titi monkeys (squirrel monkey). They have since put up 130 bridges and 14 different animal species have been using them. Meanwhile, the titi monkey population has doubled. Whenever an arboreal animal is electrocuted by live wires, hit by a car, or attacked by dogs, KSTR reviews the necessity of a bridge and places it for them to cross high off the ground. 

Since its inception, KSTR has planted over 7,000 trees, is in the process of planting another 80,000 on donated property elsewhere in Costa Rica, and reforests in other countries as well. 

In order to run its facility and care for the animals, KSTR relies on volunteers who come in from around the world to help with all aspects of its programs. The volunteers clean, repair, and build cages, work on trails, prepare food for the animals, observe behavior, and more. Many volunteers are housed where they work at KSTR, but some opt for a day of volunteer work offered by area tour companies.

A key element of KSTR is education about biodiversity conservation. Visitors who take the tours of the facility are given an educational talk about the rainforest and its inhabitants.

KSTR operates entirely on donations.

Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council

Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council (DMMC) is the local authority for the city of Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia in Sri Lanka. The Council is responsible for providing a variety of local public services including roads, sanitation, drains, housing, libraries, public parks and recreational facilities. It has 48 members elected under the mixed electoral system where 60% of members will be elected using first-past-the-post voting and the remaining 40% through closed list proportional representation. 

The area covered by the present Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipal Council was part of the Kingdom of Kotte. It comprised a number of villages, including Pepiliyana Nedimala, Attidiya and Kalubowila. The areas south of Dehiwala together with Ratmalana were one large expanse of marshland that was sparsely populated.

In the late 16th century the Kingdom of Kotte was ruled by the Portuguese controlled king, Dharmapala. The administrative structure of the area during this time was the Gansabha system as prevailed earlier. In the early 17th century, the Dutch brought a more organised administrative structure from which a broad based taxation and legal system evolved. In the 19th Century the British replaced this with a provincial administrative (Kachcheri) system, which led to the current form of local government developing.

In 1937 Dehiwela-Mount Lavinia was a local body of six wards extending over . In 1959 this area was extended and divided into nineteen wards and given municipal status because of its rapid urban growth and for administrative reasons. In 1967 the municipal area of approximately was apportioned into 29 wards, as it exists today.

Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Municipality area is a multi-religious, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural city.

Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia municipality is the second largest in Sri Lanka covering . It lies to the south of the Colombo Municipal Council area separated by the Dehiwala canal which acts as the northern boundary of the municipality. Borupana Road lies at the southern limits and Weras Ganga to the east.

Nggamadi

The Nggamadi were an indigenous Australian people of the Cape York Peninsula of northern Queensland.

They are often conflated with the Ankamuti, but Tindale regarded them as a separate tribal reality. Terry Crowley writes:-
'In the region referred to locally as the 'Seven Rivers' area (the seven rivers being the Jardine, MacDonald, Skardon, Doughboy, Ducie and Jackson Rivers, and Crystal Creek), which constitutes the very narrow coastal stretch from the northern side of Port Musgrave as far as the Doughboy River, and also the inland area of Crystal Creek and the middle Jardine River, were the "aŋkamuṯi"-speaking people. The non-coastal "aŋkamuṯi" of the Jardine River were alternatively called "yampaɣuƫaŋu" or "utuðanamu" (meaning 'leaf people' and 'scrub dwellers' respectively). The "aŋkamuṯi" have previously been referred to in the literature by the name "ŋkamuṯi" ('Gamiti' in Roth 1910:96), "Ngkamadyi" in McConnel (1939-1940:60) and "Nggammadi" in Sharp (1939:257), which was used for the "aŋkamuṯi" by the CV-dropping groups to the south of Port Musgrave (Crowley 1981:146).

Norman Tindale estimated that the Nggamadi had about of territory. They lay north of the Dulhunty River as far as around Vrilya Point (Cockatoo Creek), and were present also at the Jackson and Skardon rivers.

South River (Ontario)

The South is a river in the Almaguin Highlands region of Parry Sound District, Ontario, beginning in the Western Uplands of Algonquin Provincial Park and emptying into Lake Nipissing. The river takes its name from the part of Lake Nipissing that it flows into, South Bay.

Situated in the northwestern quadrant of the Algonquin Dome (of which the Almaguin Highlands form the western edge) the headwaters of the South are located in wetlands north of Togo Lake at an elevation of 465 m. The river heads in a northwesterly direction, meandering through the Almaguin Highlands before emptying into Lake Nipissing at 195m, descending some 270m along its course.

The South has a number of smaller tributaries, chief among them are, Paul, Beatty, Genesee, McGillvray, Black (Gurd), Trout, Bray, Black (Machar), Smyth, and Craig.

An estimated 4750 people live along the South, the river itself giving rise to many villages in the Highlands, including Nipissing, Powassan, Trout Creek, and the eponymous South River. These communities were built around the rapids and waterfalls along the river, harnessing the energy and force of the cascading water to power sawmills in the 19th century. Logging was the chief industry in the region, attracting many pioneers, settlers, immigrants, and lumber barons, all seeking a livelihood from the vast resources of timber that abounded in the river’s watershed.
The South flows through the following townships: (from upstream to downstream) Paxton (unorganized Nipissing District), Joly, Laurier, Machar, Gurd, Powassan (South Himsworth), and Nipissing.

There are numerous control and electricity producing dams located on the South, making use of the rapids and waterfalls much the same way the early sawmills did. Ownership of the dams is a mix of private companies and government corporations.

The South has always been a popular canoe route, with arguably the most famous person to paddle its waters and take inspiration from it, being the early 20th century artist Tom Thomson. In the Village of South River on the shores of the waterway is located the Tom Thomson Park, the site in which Thomson would pull his canoe from the river and board the train bound for his studio and clients in Southern Ontario.
The Municipality of Powassan organizes a canoe race every summer along the portion of the river within its boundaries.
There are numerous wilderness outfitters and tourist camps interspersed with private cottages and homes dotting the shores of the South.

Nun's Island Distillery

Nun's Island Distillery was an Irish whiskey distillery which operated in Galway, Ireland, from at least 1815, and possibly as early as the late 1700s, until circa 1908.

At its peak, in the late 1800s, output at the distillery reached 400,000 gallons per annum, and with a workforce of over 100, the distillery was one of the largest local employers. Owned by the Persse family from the 1840s onwards, the distillery produced single pot still whiskey known as Persse's Galway Whiskey. The whiskey was sold locally in Connacht, where for much of the 1800s, Nun's Island was the only licensed distillery. However, it was also exported, and is said to have been a sold to the British House of Commons, a fact proudly noted on their labels.

Production at the distillery ceased circa 1908, with the remaining stocks wound down off over several few years.

A bottle of Persse's whiskey was placed for auction in 2002 with a reserve price of £100,000 - however, it failed to sell. The bottle later sold for £3,300 in 2014.

The early history of the distillery is somewhat difficult to piece together. It is known that a distillery on Nun's Island was being operated on by a John Joyce in the late 1700s. This distillery, which was subsequently taken over by Patrick Joyce, is thought to have ceased operations in 1807.

A Patrick Joyce is recorded as running a small distillery on Nun's Island again in 1823. Therefore, it is possible that the closure was temporary. By 1828, output at the distillery had increased to 130,000 proof gallons per annum. There are claims that the distillery ceased operations again in the late 1830s. However, a newspaper advertisement from 1841 reports that a distillery "lately occupied and worked" by Messrs. James and Patrick Joyce was to be sold on 4 February 1841. The advertisement noted that the distillery was held under a 300-year lease, which had commenced in August 1815. This tallies with Alfred Barnard's 1887 report that Joyce's owned the distillery from 1815 to 1840.

In about 1840 or 1841, the distillery was purchased by the Persses, a local family who ran several other distilleries in the area. There is some conflicting information with regard to the precise and nature of the sale date. Barnard reported that the distillery was sold by the Encumbered Claims Courts in 1840. However, a newspaper article from the era reports that the distillery was to be sold by private contract in February 1841. As Barnard mentions that the Persses enlarged the original operation, the confusion may be due to piecemeal purchases of different sections of the site, or delays in finalising the sale as the distillery had been repeatedly advertised for sale beginning in at least early 1840.

Initially the Persses converted the distillery to a woollen mill, which was known for producing excellent friezes. However, when their lease on the nearby Newcastle Distillery expired in 1846, they moved their distilling operations at the Nun's Island complex, and re-established the site as a distillery.

In 1886, the distillery was visited by British historian Alfred Barnard, as recounted in his seminal publication "The Whiskey Distilleries of the United Kingdom". Barnard noted that at the time of his visit Nun's Island was the sole distillery operating in Connacht, and had an output of about 400,000 gallons per annum. In addition to offices, workshops, stables, and storehouses, the distillery buildings included two lofty Maltings and Corn stores built of stone, five storeys of which were devoted to the storing of corn, and two to malting purposes; an elegant brew house equal to any in Ireland; a back house containing thirteen washbacks, each with a capacity of about 18,000 gallons; a still house containing a 16,000 gallon wash still, a 10,000 gallon spirit still, and a 6,000 gallon low-wines still; a spirit store occupied by a 12,000 gallon vat; and five warehouses, holding a total of about 5,000 casks at the time.

Like many other Irish distilleries, Nun's Island encountered financial difficulties during the early part of the 20th Century, is thought to have closed shortly before World War I.

Since closing, some of the distillery complex has been demolished. However, several of the main distillery buildings, notably the large riverside warehouse, are still extant.

Cap and Bells (horse)

Cap and Bells (known in England as Cap and Bells II, 1898 – after 1916) was an American-bred Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. After showing promising form in the United States as a juvenile in 1900 she was set to race in England. In June 1901 on her British debut she recorded an emphatic win in the Epsom Oaks, becoming the first American horse to do so. She never recaptured her Epsom form and was retired from racing in 1903. After returning to United States she had some success as a broodmare.

Cap and Bells was a bay or brown mare bred in Kentucky by the father and son partnership of James R. Keene and Foxhall Keene the latter of whom owned her during her racing career. She was initially sent into training in the United States.

She was from the second of only two crops of foals sired by Domino, an outstanding American racehorse who died in 1897 at the age of six. Her dam, the British-bred mare Ben-My-Chree,was a daughter of Ulster Queen, making her a close relative of Louvois (2000 Guineas) and Louviers (runner-up in the Epsom Derby).

At Brighton Beach Racetrack on 24 July Cap and Bells won the Spinster Stakes, beating the favourite Sweet Lavender "with ease". On 25 August the filly was stepped up in class for the Belmont Futurity Stakes which at that time was the most important race for two-year-olds in the United States. She led the field until the home but faded down the stretch and finished unplaced behind W. C. Whitney's Ballyhoo Bey. Shortly after the race it was announced that Keene intended to campaign his filly in England in 1901.

On her arrival in England Cap and Bells entered training with Sam Darling at his stable at Beckhampton in Wiltshire.

On 7 June Cap and Bells, ridden by the American jockey Milton Henry, was one of twenty-one fillies to contest the 123rd running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. The race was run in fine weather in front of a near-record crowd. Despite her lack of experience on the surface (turf) and the distance she was made the 9/4 favourite, with Lord Derby's filly Santa Brigida (third in the 1000 Guineas) the only one of her opponents to start at less than 10/1. She had not been among the favourites in the build-up but was heavily backed on the morning of the race. The favourite's stablemate Noonday set the pace and led the field into the straight but Cap and Bells went to the front soon after and drew away to win "in a canter" by six lengths. Lord Ellesmere's 50/1 outsider Sabrinetta (ridden by the American C Jenkins) finished second, with three lengths back to Minnie Dee (owned by Richard Croker and ridden by another American Lester Reiff) in third place. According to the "Los Angeles Herald" "the race furnished extraordinary proof of the superior ability of American breeders, trainers and jockeys". Foxhall Keene donated the prize-money to British and American charities, including the Prince of Wales's Hospital Fund.

Later that year, Keene reportedly declined an offer to match his filly against W. C. Whitney's Epsom Derby winner Volodyovski.

Cap and Bells remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover her best form. In the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot in June she finished tailed-off in last place behind William the Third. Cap and Bells returned to the United States in 1903.

In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cap and Bells a "superior" winner of the Oaks.

At the end of her racing career, Cap and Bells was retired to become a broodmare for the Keenes' stud. he produced at least eight foals between 1905 and 1916:

Nicolas Saboly

Nicolas Saboly (30 January 1614 – 26 July 1675) was a French poet, composer and choirmaster. He composed many Christmas carols in the Provençal dialect which form one of the monuments of poetry in that language and have been repeatedly republished until the present day.

Nicolas Saboly was born on 31 January 1614 in Monteux to a family of herdsmen.
His great-grandfather Claude Saboly and his grandfather Raymond Saboly followed this occupation. 
It was Raymond Saboly who came to settle in Monteux.
Nicolas was the youngest son of Felisa Meilheuret and Jean Saboly.
He had an older brother named Jean-Pierre Saboly and three sisters named Anne, Félicia (Felisa) and Claire.

Saboly's father died on 15 August 1619, and Nicolas entered the Jesuit college of Carpentras. 
At the end of his schooling he became a member of the Congregation of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin on 14 May 1628.
In the autumn of 1628 he left his college to begin taking classes at the University of Avignon. 
He received the tonsure in 1630 and attended courses in law and theology, as evidenced by two notarial acts of 12 March 1632 and 27 December 1633, which he witnessed as a student of theology. 
In 1634 he left the University without taking his degrees. 
On 27 September 1635 he was ordained a sub-deacon, deacon and priest.

In 1639 Nicolas Saboly obtained the position of organist and choirmaster of the Saint-Siffrein Cathedral in Carpentras.
He was occasionally employed in local festivals, such as on 22 September 1639 when the clergy of Caromb asked him to play the organ for the parish festival of St. Maurice.
He received 10 florins and 12 sous for his performance.
His name disappears from the accounts of Saint-Siffrein after 20 June 1643, when he was replaced by the choirmaster David.

Nicolas Saboly went to Arles where he was choirmaster from 1643 to 1646, then the cathedral of Aix-en-Provence from 1652 to 1655.
He was in Nîmes in 1659.
He was choirmaster of the collegiate church of Saint-Pierre d'Avignon from before 1668 until his death.

Like many priests of his time, Saboly obtained several ecclesiastical benefits. 
On 16 April 1633 he became chaplain of St. Mary Magdalene in the Cathedral of Saint Siffrein in Carpentras.
He kept this benefice until 1663.
On 28 March 1658 he was issued a certificate of studies that found he had attended courses at the University of Avignon from 1628 to 1634, and was given a certificate of aptitude for obtaining profits in the dioceses of Nîmes and Uzès.

On 10 June 1660, after a lengthy process, he obtained a pension of 100 lt. (livre tournois) from the papal administration to take on the priory and the benefit of Saint-Benoît-de-Cayran in the diocese of Uzès.
After returning to Avignon he obtained the chaplaincy of Saint Mary, which he still held in 1663.

On 21 April 1671 Saboly's will was notarized by François Julien in Marseilles.
Saboly made his niece Claire Saboly (wife of Christophe Chardenas, bourgeois of Roquemaure, Gard) ) his universal heiress. 
He also bequeathed 600 lt. to his servant Isabeau Sevique, and reserved from his niece's legacy an annuity with 600 lt. of capital yielding 30 lt. annually to be paid to the chapter of Saint-Pierre d'Avignon so that after his death two masses would be said each week in his memory. 
He died four years later on 25 July 1675 in Avignon.
He is buried in the choir of the Saint-Pierre church.

Saboly's career as a choirmaster was standard for this period. 
He is famous for the carols that he composed.


The first editions of Saboly's carols consist of eight bound instalments, dated between 1668 and 1674, kept in Paris Ars. : BL 9478. The titles of the instalments are:



In the second part of the 19th century Saboly's were often published with those of Antoine Peyrol (18th century) and Joseph Roumanille (1818-1891). 
These many editions reflect the literary movement of the Félibriges. The list below is not exhaustive.


Saboly did not compose all the Christmas carols that were attributed to him. 
They were originally published without music because they were sung to popular tunes that everyone knew by heart.
Saboly simply gave a note like "on the air of the echo", "on the air of the pastouro" or sometimes "On an air by Saboly".

The Provencal Documentation Center has retained in its booklet devoted to this author a list of 48 carols definitely composed by Saboly.

Following are the carols are according to the François Seguin edition of 1856:

First book (1667)

Second book (1668)

Third book (1669)

Fourth book, titled "Story of the birth of Jesus Christ" (1670)

Fifth book (1671)

Toowoomba East State School

Toowoomba East State School is a heritage-listed state school on the corner of Arthur and Mary Streets, East Toowoomba, Toowoomba Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1935 to 1936 by the Queensland Department of Public Works. It was originally known as Queen's Park State School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2017.

Toowoomba East State School (SS) opened in 1887, on its current site east of Queens Park, to service the population growth in East Toowoomba at the time. The school is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. The school retains a Depression-era brick school building (Block A, 1936); set in landscaped grounds, with sporting facilities and mature trees. The school has been in continuous operation since its establishment.

Traditional country of the Giabal and Jarowair people, European settlement of the Toowoomba area commenced in 1840 when squatters occupied pastoral runs on the Darling Downs. At the junction of two routes to Gorman's and Hodgson's gaps through the Main Range, the small settlement of Drayton evolved from 1842 as a stopping place for pastoralists and travellers. Six kilometres to its north-east was an area known as "The Swamp" - renamed Toowoomba by 1859 - which was first surveyed in 1849 as 12 suburban allotments of Drayton.

Toowoomba grew rapidly due to its superior land and water supply, support from squatters and land speculators, and, from 1855, providing an easier route to Brisbane via the Toll Bar Road. Toowoomba was declared a municipality (the Borough of Toowoomba) in July 1860, and by the 1861 census it was clear that Toowoomba had eclipsed Drayton. The Main Line railway arrived in 1867 (connecting to Brisbane in 1876), and Toowoomba's economy diversified to include numerous small-scale manufacturing outlets, while the majority of administrative, service and other government and education functions for the surrounding region were centred on the town. Toowoomba was also popular as a summer retreat for the colony's elite. It was declared a city (the City of Toowoomba) in 1904 and by 1911 had a population of 10,636.

Toowoomba was an early centre for education, with the area's first National School (later Toowoomba South State School) opening in 1865. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early/new communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.

To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.

Toowoomba East SS, opened on 17 January 1887, was established on a 2.5 acre (1ha) reserve for a National School at the corner of Mary Street and Margaret Street, which had been gazetted in 1872. Although there was local pressure for a school in East Toowoomba from 1876, when fund raising by the community began, the population was not large enough to justify a state school. As a result of later population growth, the Queensland Government approved a school in East Toowoomba in October 1885. By this time the community had collected £200 of the £290 required as its one-fifth share of the £1433 construction cost, and the school was also initially referred to as Queen's Park State School. The school consisted of a timber building set on brick piers, with two classrooms, close to the corner of Mary Street and Arthur Street. It was designed to accommodate 250 students, and had admitted 235 students by February 1887.

Growing student numbers - with 778 enrolled by 1927 - soon led to additions to Toowoomba East SS. By 1913 there were three timber buildings; a fourth (Infants) wing was added in 1928; and a fifth wing in 1932. A school residence, built in 1889, stood in the southeast corner of the reserve, fronting Mary Street; and a school bell on a stand was erected the same year.

As well as more buildings, the school required larger grounds to cater for growing student numbers. In 1926, 1.25 acres (0.5ha) of land was added.

The school was also beautified by tree plantings from 1888, including on the west side of the original school reserve and along its Arthur and Mary Street frontages. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land. Twelve camphor laurels were planted along the west fence in 1898, to provide shelter from westerly winds and by 1922 Toowoomba East SS had "large camphor and other ornamental and shade trees".

The school's timber buildings were still not sufficient for student numbers, and in the mid-1930s a new brick school building was approved for Toowoomba East SS. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of public building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building program to provide impetus to the economy.

Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work program administered by the Department of Public Works (DPW). This included painting and repairs to school buildings. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.

In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public building program designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. The construction of substantial brick school buildings in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation.

Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Most were designed in a classical idiom to project the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical plan form and often exhibited a prominent central entry. The plan arrangement was similar to that of timber buildings, being only one classroom deep, accessed by a long straight verandah or corridor. Due to their long plan forms of multiple wings, they could be built in stages if necessary; resulting in some complete designs never being realised. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions.

Despite their similarities, each Depression-era brick school building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles were derived from contemporary tastes and fashions. Over time, variations occurred in building size, decorative treatment, and climatic-responsive features.

Construction of the Depression-era brick school building (Block A in 2017) at Toowoomba East SS occurred during 1935-36, for a cost of £16,326. The new building was sited parallel to, and facing, Arthur Street, after relocation of the old timber buildings. As the new building was only designed for 640 students, and enrolment was 1000 by the time it was officially opened on 8 May 1937 by James Kane, the Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for East Toowoomba, it was necessary to retain at least four of the old timber buildings. These were relocated at a distance behind the new brick building to form a parade ground between them. The school residence was removed .

Block A was constructed with three levels, consisting of an undercroft with two floors of eight classrooms above, for a total of 16 classrooms. The undercroft comprised play areas with concrete floors and drinking troughs and had openings leading out to the grounds via broad concrete stairs. The first and second floors had similar layouts. They comprised a long wing of six classrooms divided by a central stairwell. The eastern three classrooms had connecting doors; while the western three classrooms were separated by folding partitions, which could be opened to form a large assembly room. Each classroom was oriented so that students faced west to a wall-mounted hyloplate (blackboard) and had two large banks of windows on their south side, giving gentle southern natural left-hand light to students, forced to write with their right hand. A verandah-like, open corridor ran along the north side of the classrooms providing access. Projecting north from the corridor was a central entrance block. On the first floor this comprised an entry hall, reached from the front garden by a branching stair, with a head teachers and male teachers room, one either side of the hall. On the second floor, this block comprised a female teachers room and a cloak room. At each end of the long wing was a short perpendicular wing, comprising a stairwell, perpendicular corridor, cloak room and another classroom, which had north-facing windows and hyloplates on the east wall to ensure light from the "correct" side. At the landing of the central stairwell between first and second floors was a balconette that opened out to the south side overlooking the parade ground behind.

The walls of the three storeys were differentiated, with painted cement render on the undercroft, exposed brickwork for the first floor up to the window sill height of the second floor, and painted cement render above that to the eaves line. Sunhoods, supported on substantial timber brackets, shaded all banks of windows on the first and second floors. The hipped and gabled roof was clad with asbestos cement shingles, and the three gables on the north side of the building were battened and clad with fibro-cement. A large ventilation fleche topped the centre of the roof above the entrance.

During the 1950s further additions were made to the school's accommodation and grounds. In 1955, additional land was added to the west side of the school grounds, resumed from neighbouring residential allotments. Later grounds extensions, to the west and south of the original school reserve, from the 1960s onwards, meant that by 2012 the grounds covered 3.4ha. By 1956 a highset brick extension (Block B in 2017), with two classrooms had been constructed attached to the west end of the rear (south) of Block A. This building was renovated in , enclosing its verandahs and demolishing the wall between verandahs and classrooms to create larger teaching areas.

Changes were also made to Block A. In 1966, the cloak room at the west end of the first floor was converted into a Health Services room. In , two classrooms at the east end of the first floor of the centre wing were used as staff rooms, while another classroom was used as the principal's office, and another was divided in half by a partition to accommodate a store room and Health Services Room. One cloak room was converted to a store room while another was a converted to a work room. In , the undercroft was partially enclosed with glass louvres and doors. The northern corridors were enclosed with glazing by 1997. In , the centre wing was altered in "upgrading" works. This involved partitioning the northern corridors on both floors to create practical learning areas; replacing the French doors from the corridor into the classrooms with a single wide door with a half leaf; demolishing partitions between the classrooms on both floors to create two classrooms out of each set of three; and relining the ceilings with flat sheets to provide fire proofing.

Changes and additions to facilities since the 1960s have included: a school swimming pool (1966); new classroom buildings (1969-71); the removal of three of the early timber school buildings in the 1970s; a new library and a dental clinic facing Mary Street (1973); two pre-school buildings south of the swimming pool, near Margaret Street (by 1978); a Centenary Hall facing Arthur Street; covered ways south of Block A; and a new administration building north of Block A (1991). The last of the early school buildings, the 1928 Infants building (later designated the Clare Gormley Block), was demolished sometime between 2009 and 2011. In 2015, 807 students were enrolled. Students utilise sports fields in Queens Park to the west, and the Clive Berghofer Stadium to the north.

In 2017, Toowoomba East State School continues to operate from its original site, and its Depression-era brick school building is a local landmark. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there.

Toowoomba East State School occupies a large, 3.37ha site in East Toowoomba, fronting Arthur Street to the north and bounded by Mary Street to the east. A substantial Depression-era brick school building, Block A, stands at the front of the school grounds, surrounded by mature trees and gardens. Attractive views are had to and from the school and it is conspicuous in the area due to its handsome architecture, open playing fields, and impressive mature trees.

Block A is a symmetrical two-storey building set high on an open undercroft level and has a hipped and gabled roof clad with tiles. At the roof's central peak is a prominent metal ventilation fleche with round cupola, visible from the surrounding residential neighbourhood. The building character expresses a composed simplicity through the use of attractive, simple, and low maintenance materials with minimal decorative features, including extensive use of glazed dark face bricks internally and externally contrasting with smooth-rendered concrete dressings and plain, regular fenestration.

The building comprises an undercroft level of open play spaces below two levels of teaching rooms and its facades are defined horizontally with three materials: smooth-rendered masonry with lined coursing at undercroft level; facebrick for the first floor up to the sill level of the second floor; and painted roughcast render above. The building form is a long wing of classrooms with a centre stairwell. A long corridor across the front (north) of this wing provides access to the rooms. The corridor has simple rendered balustrades with square balusters; it has square openings on the first floor and arched openings on the second floor. However, these openings have been enclosed with later glazing that is not of cultural heritage significance. Projecting forward of the centre of the corridor is an entrance block of primarily teachers rooms, and at either end of the long wing is a short perpendicular wing comprising a classroom, a former cloak room, and a stairwell. The central entrance block and the end wings are emphasised by front-facing gable roofs with timber battening, banks of multi-paned timber-framed casement windows with fanlights, and window hoods supported by large timber brackets. At the centre of the entrance block is a branching cement rendered stair with simple metal balustrades. It leads up to the front arched doorway, which is flanked by narrow window openings and shaded by a window hood that features a battened triangular pediment.

The building layout is highly intact, retaining its original configuration. The undercroft retains original perimeter seats, metal grilles to openings, and rounded corners to the brick pillars. However, some new lightweight partitions have been installed to create storage spaces, which are not of cultural heritage significance. The undercroft play area is connected to bitumen-surfaced play areas in front and behind the building via multiple openings and broad concrete steps.

The first floor configuration comprises a short entrance hall with teachers rooms either side, leading to the corridor and classrooms behind. The wall between the corridor and the classrooms retains tall, double hung timber-framed windows, and French doors with fanlights, and although some French doors have been replaced with later doors, the fanlights survive throughout. However, the partitions between the classrooms of the centre wing have been removed to create larger classrooms, with nibs and bulkheads retained to indicate their former location. New partitions have been installed in one classroom and to enclose the cloak rooms for further staff rooms, and in the centre wing to create larger classrooms.

The first and second floors are very similar configurations, with identical removal of partitions and similar insertion of new partitions.

On both levels, the classrooms feature abundant natural light, simple timber joinery, and lofty ceilings. The corridors, cloak rooms, stairwells, and stairwells have smooth concrete ceilings, which is the original condition. The classrooms of the end wings retain the original sheets and battens lined ceilings but those of the centre wing are lined with recent flat sheet material and have modern cornices. The stairwells have simple iron balustrades with moulded clear-finished timber handrails and concrete stairs.

At the stair landing between first and second floors of the centre stairwell, a set of timber-framed, glazed French doors lead out onto a narrow balcony that overlooks a parade ground immediately to the rear of the building. Capable of only accommodating one or two people, the balcony is the centre and focus of the southern facade composition, emphasised by a small projecting bay with a triangular pediment at the roofline bearing "1936" in raised, rendered numerals, and including a moulded rendered architrave that stretches up to the second floor window above, topped by a stylised "keystone". The balcony is supported by scrolled rendered brackets and has a simple metal balustrade with an attached metal flagpole. It draws attention through its use of decoration on an otherwise simple facade and being centred under the tall roof fleche.

Attached to the western end of Block A is a high-set one storey classroom building, Block B (by 1956), which is not heritage-listed. A doorway has been cut into the rear (south) wall of the first floor stairway at this end of Block A to connect through to the building.

The grounds of the school are largely flat with open playing areas and other teaching buildings. The boundaries of the school have mature trees, including camphor laurels ("Cinnamomum camphora") at regularly spaced intervals and other specimen trees, including jacarandas ("Jacaranda mimosifolia").

The main front entrance to the school is emphasised with a metal arch with "EAST STATE SCHOOL" in metal letters over a concrete path flanked by long, stone edged garden beds. This entrance is aligned with the centre of Block A.

Other stone edged garden beds stand around the base of Block A.

At the rear of Block A is a large open bitumen-surfaced parade ground. This is a simple and plain area that provides an unfussy setting to and allows uninterrupted views of Block A, as well as an open and flexible playing and assembly space for the school.

An early metal school bell stands on a tall post in the rear parade ground close to the southern wall of Block A.

Views to Block A occur from the surrounding residential neighbourhood and Toowoomba East State School is an attractive and prominent element in the built landscape.

Toowoomba East State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 28 July 2017 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.

Toowoomba East State School (established in 1887) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains an excellent, representative example of a government-designed school building that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies.

The Depression-era brick school building (1936) is a result of the Queensland Government's building and relief work programs during the 1930s that stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.

Toowoomba East State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school built during the Depression-era. These include: a large brick school building set in landscaped grounds with mature shade trees, assembly, play, and sports areas.

The Depression-era brick school building is an excellent, substantial, and intact example of its type, demonstrating the principal characteristics, which include: a handsome edifice standing at the front of the school; symmetrical two-storey form of classrooms and teachers rooms above an undercroft of open play spaces; a linear layout of the main floors with rooms accessed by corridors; loadbearing masonry construction; prominent projecting central entrance bay, and high-quality design to provide superior educational environments that focus on abundant natural light and ventilation. It demonstrates the use of stylistic features of its era, which determined its roof form, joinery, and decorative treatment.

The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.

Through its conspicuous position at the front of the school, substantial size and height, symmetry, elegant composition, restrained use of decoration, and fine craftsmanship, the Depression-era brick school building has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, by which the Department of Public Works sought to convey the concepts of progress and permanence.

The building is also significant for its streetscape contribution. Framed by mature trees, it is an attractive and prominent feature of the area.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.

Toowoomba East State School has a strong and ongoing association with the community. It was established in 1887 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of Toowoomba children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Toowoomba and is a prominent community focal point.

World Cities Culture Forum

The World Cities Culture Forum is a network of local governments and cultural sector leaders from 37 world cities.

The World Cities Culture Forum was established in London in 2012 with eight cities (London, New York City, Tokyo, Shanghai, Paris, Istanbul, Sydney and Johannesburg) convened by the Mayor of London..

The World Cities Culture Forum has 37 participating member cities across seven geographic regions.


The World Cities Culture Forum is convened by Justine Simons, Deputy Mayor for Culture and Creative Industries, Greater London Authority, at the request of the Mayor of London.

The activities of the World Cities Culture Forum are organised and delivered by BOP Consulting, a specialist consulting firm, on behalf of the Greater London Authority and the members of the Forum.

In 2016, the World Cities Culture Forum set up two advisory committees in order to involve members in co-designing its programme and research. There is an Event Advisory Committee and a Research Advisory Committee with five different cities represented on each committee.

Each year, members of the World Cities Culture Forum meet at the three-day World Cities Culture Summit. The Summit is an opportunity for members to share best practice.

The event is by invitation only. Two delegates from each member city – deputy mayors, senior policymakers or advisors in culture – are invited to attend.

Previous Summits have taken place in Seoul, Moscow, London, Shanghai, Amsterdam, Istanbul and Buenos Aires.

The 2018 World Cities Culture Summit will take place in San Francisco.

Underpinning the World Cities Culture Forum’s work is an extensive programme of research and publications.

The World Cities Culture Report is the network’s flagship publication. It is a compendium of data and innovative policies in cities, providing an analysis of comparative data and identifying emerging issues. It is published on a triennial basis. The first version of this report was launched in London during the 2012 Summer Olympics. The next edition of the World Cities Culture Report will be published in November 2018.

The World Cities Culture Forum Policy & Practice Series highlight members’ best practice initiatives on specific topics. The most recent publications of this series are the ‘Making Space for Culture Handbook for City Leaders’, a series of case studies to help policymakers better understand the options available to protect and develop cultural spaces, and the ‘Culture and Climate Change Handbook for City Leaders’, a report about the ways in which cities can integrate environmental sustainability into cultural policymaking.

The World Cities Culture Finance Report is the first comparative analysis of culture financing in world cities. It was first published in 2017 and is updated on an annual basis.

The World Cities Culture Forum database is a comprehensive database on culture in world cities. It contains over 70 indicators on cultural infrastructure and cultural consumption in member world cities

A new World Cities Culture Forum Leadership Exchange Programme was created in 2017. The programme supports direct exchanges of learning between member cities through in-depth exchange visits. It is funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Google Arts & Culture.

The Railway Detective

The Railway Detective is the eponymous opening title in the series of detective mystery novels written by Keith Miles under the pseudonym Edward Marston. Set in 1851, it is about a railway robbery which is investigated and ultimately solved by two Scotland Yard detectives, Inspector Robert Colbeck and Sergeant Victor Leeming. The novel was published in 2004 by Allison & Busby of London. The book's cover depicts part of "The Railway Station" (1862) by William Powell Frith. According to the publishers in a 2018 news release, the series has been optioned for television adaptation by Mammoth Screen.

In April 1851, shortly before the opening of the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, London, a mail train on the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR) is halted between Leighton Buzzard Junction and Linslade Tunnel by a group of men disguised as railway police. Using duplicated Chubb safe keys, they steal all the mailbags and a consignment of over £3,000 in sovereigns being transferred from the Royal Mint to a bank in Birmingham. The train driver, who tries to resist the robbers, is badly injured and his fireman is forced to drive the engine forward to where a section of track has been removed, causing a derailment. The robbers escape and the alarm is raised by telegraph to the Metropolitan Police Force in Scotland Yard, London, where it is received by Detective Superintendent Edward Tallis, head of the Detective Department.

Tallis summons Detective Inspector Robert Colbeck to his office and orders him to lead the investigation. It is quickly established that there is an "unresolved tension" between Tallis and Colbeck which is an underlying theme of the whole series, although the two have great professional respect for each other. Colbeck and Detective Sergeant Victor Leeming travel to Leighton Buzzard where they meet Inspector Rory McTurk of the railway police. McTurk strongly resents their involvement but Colbeck and Leeming soon establish that members of the railway police were guilty of deserting their posts on the train in order to play cards, thus making it much easier for the gang to carry out the robbery. Meanwhile, train driver Caleb Andrews is not expected to survive and his daughter Madeleine arrives in Leighton Buzzard to care for him.

Colbeck is convinced that the gang had inside information and were certainly in possession of duplicated safe keys. He and Leeming begin enquiries at the organisations involved with the shipment: the L&NWR, the Post Office, the Royal Mint, the fictitious Spurling's Bank in Birmingham and the Chubb factory in Wolverhampton. As a result, they become aware of Daniel Slender, who duplicated the safe keys at Chubb; William Ings of the Post Office, who was involved in the mail train's scheduling; and Albert Woodhead of the Royal Mint, who unwittingly advised Ings of the gold consignment. The L&NWR and the Birmingham bank are absolved of involvement in the crime.

Ings is the first of the suspects to be pursued and Colbeck discovers that he is hiding in the notorious Devil's Acre. To find Ings, Colbeck seeks help from Brendan Mulryne, a former colleague who is now a resident there. Mulryne establishes a connection between Ings and the prostitute Polly Roach but, though he finds Roach, he is too late to prevent the murder of Ings. In due course, Slender meets a similar fate. It is clear to Colbeck that the gang are eliminating loose ends and weak links to remain undetected. Colbeck is concerned about the unnecessary destruction of the steam engine after the robbery and believes he is looking for someone with influence who hates the railways.

Although Tallis dismisses Colbeck's theory, it is valid as gang leader Sir Humphrey Gilzean has an obsessive hatred of railways. He blames them for the accidental death of his wife. The gang strikes again at the Kilsby Tunnel, placing gunpowder at one end in a bid to destroy both the tunnel and a train carrying glass sheets for use in the Crystal Palace. The explosion is detonated too soon to destroy the train and causes only superficial damage to the tunnel. Colbeck makes the connection and realises, despite more opposition from Tallis, that an attempt will be made to destroy the locomotives on display at the Great Exhibition.

Colbeck is right about the Crystal Palace and, aided by Leeming and Mulryne, is able to arrest Jukes and the Seymours one night when they try to destroy the "Lord of the Isles". The gangsters refuse to give information about their leaders. Gilzean and Sholto have added to their haul by blackmailing the senders of complicit letters which were in the stolen mailbags. They are fearful of imminent arrest and Gilzean instructs Sholto to find someone whom Colbeck cares about to distract him from the investigation. Caleb Andrews is no longer a critical case and has been taken home where Madeleine is looking after him. She has met Colbeck in the course of the investigation and there is a mutual attraction between them which develops as the novel progresses. Sholto follows Colbeck and observes the affection he has for Madeleine during a visit to the Andrews household. As a result, Gilzean and Sholto kidnap Madeleine and send a demand to the Met for the release of Jukes and the Seymours.

Working on what little is known about the three prisoners, Colbeck and Leeming discover their common military background and make the link between them and two of their former officers who both left the Army on the same day. These are Gilzean and Sholto. Colbeck establishes that Gilzean has a pathological hatred of railways and even Tallis agrees that the case has been solved, so the investigation is now a manhunt but with Madeleine's life at stake. Fortunately for Madeleine, Gilzean is protective of her and will not allow Sholto to molest her. Tallis leads a raid on Gilzean's Berkshire residence but he bungles it and the criminals escape, still holding Madeleine as a hostage.

Colbeck finds documents in Gilzean's house which convince him they are taking Madeleine to Bristol to board ship and flee the country. The criminals are travelling by road and so Colbeck and Leeming go to Bristol via the Great Western Railway (GWR). They arrive first and intercept the two criminals on board their ship in harbour. Madeleine, unharmed, is freed and reunited with her father. The bond between Colbeck and Madeleine is permanent and, when Colbeck receives two complimentary tickets from the grateful Prince Albert for the opening of the Great Exhibition, he invites Madeleine to join him.




The Detective Department of the Metropolitan Police Force (the Met) was founded in 1842 and so was only nine years old in 1851, when the story is set. Richard Mayne, who was the joint first commissioner of the Met, is depicted in meetings with Tallis, Colbeck and Leeming. His co-commissioner, Charles Rowan, had retired the year before. Mayne was in charge of policing at The Great Exhibition which opened on 1 May and was an outstanding success, thanks in no small part to effective policing. Mayne is the only real person who plays an active part in the novel.

The novel mentions Prince Albert as the exhibition organiser and Joseph Paxton as its main designer. Gilzean's hatred of Paxton was because of Paxton being a director of the Midland Railway, whose chairman John Ellis is an enemy of Gilzean. The "Lord of the Isles" was a noted locomotive which was displayed at the Great Exhibition before it entered service on the Great Western Railway (GWR). Colbeck mentions the 6-2-0 "Liverpool", the "Puffing Billy" and the 4-2-2 "Iron Duke" in the context of the exhibition. In the second book, when Madeleine begins to seriously pursue her hobby of locomotive artworks, the "Lord of the Isles" is her first subject. 

Caleb Andrews drives for the L&NWR but his train was travelling on the route built by the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR) and opened in 1838. The L&BR was amalgamated into the L&NWR in 1846, having been operational since 1833. Robert Stephenson was the L&BR chief engineer. The line from Euston to Birmingham included the Linslade and Kilsby tunnels which both feature prominently in the book. Marston describes the problems Stephenson faced at Kilsby, where quicksand was unexpectedly encountered. The Crystal Palace's construction materials, its cast iron framework and sheets of glass, were manufactured in Birmingham and Smethwick, so they were transported by rail through the Kilsby tunnel to London.

Train robbery was a new phenomenon in the 1850s. There were two in reality before 1851, both on the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1849. Security was non-existent and the robbers in each case climbed out of their own carriage into the mail van and back. The first major incident was the Great Gold Robbery on the South Eastern Railway in May 1855. The first train robbery in America was by the Reno Gang in Indiana in 1866; there were more infamous robberies in later years by the James–Younger Gang and Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch.

The Birmingham bank manager, Ernest Kitson, explains to Colbeck the purpose of the Bank Charter Act 1844 which was introduced by the late Robert Peel as prime minister. The Act is often called the "Peel Banking Act". It placed strict limits on the issue of banknotes by individual banks who were required to balance all banknotes in their possession with a requisite supply of gold coin or bullion. In the novel, it is because Spurling's fully complied with these rules that a gold consignment was being sent to them.

On his trip to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Colbeck is disturbed by seeing the Black Country and afterwards tells Leeming that he now understands exactly what William Blake meant when he wrote about the "dark, satanic mills". Colbeck is nevertheless intrigued by industry, especially the railways, and in conversations he refers to Edward Bury, Thomas Russell Crampton and Daniel Gooch as engineers and locomotive designers he especially admires. Caleb Andrews speaks well of Alexander Allan, who claimed to be the designer of the Crewe type locomotive involved in the robbery. The engine was a 2-4-0 introduced by the L&NWR for freight in 1845. Allan was L&NWR works manager at Crewe Works from 1843 to 1853.

Lungzubel

Lungzubel which means "Stone rice beer containers or jars" in the Biate language are stone relics found in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district in Assam and its surrounding areas extending to the neighboring state of Meghalaya.
Lungzubel means a rice beer jar or container in the Biate language. The literal meaning of Lungzubel are – 'Lung' means Stone, 'Zu' means Rice beer and 'Bel' means Jar, which comes together as “Stone Rice Beer Jar”.

Lungzubels are one of the historical treasures of the Biate tribe. However, the origin of the Lungzubels remains shrouded in obscurity. According to Biate legends and elders, erection and carving of stone monuments has been the cultural practice of the Biate tribe from time immemorial, the most popular among them viz. the Lungzubels, Lungmaicham (Stone alter) etc. These stone monuments or relics are generally a pictogram of a successful or triumphant Biate chief or warriors who gained honour in the past. Moreover, the fact that rice beer used to play an important role in the rituals and festivals of the Biates in the past throw much light on why the Lungzubels were carved out. One theory also holds that these stone jars are the handiwork of Lamlira, a legendary Biate warrior who led the Biates to their present hills believed to be in the 12-13th century.

Lungzubels are not confined to a particular place but are spread out in all Biate inhabited areas in the southwestern part of Dima Hasao district and the adjoining state of Meghalaya across the Kangkalang (Kopili) river mainly in the Saipung Elaka, East Jaintia Hills district. Dr.B.Pakem, a renowned writer and former Vice-Chancellor of North Eastern Hill University also wrote that these round stones and hollow ground resemble those found in the nearby Sumer Elaka, between Umkyurpong and Kseh villages in Meghalaya. He believed that it might have been the sacrificial or dancing places of the Biates forefathers in the past. In Dima Hasao, the most well-known location is a small Biate village called Khobak, about 130 km from the district headquarters Haflong. Lungzubels are also found in some other areas albeit in small numbers. It is widely believed that these places may also have been inhabited by the Biates in olden days.

Most of the relics were gradually destroyed over time, by nature or man, as it was left abandoned and unguarded for a long time.It is believed that the advent of Christianity among the Biates in the 19th century could have been the main reason behind the neglect of these cultural treasures as Christianity doesn't encourage intoxicated drinks of any kind. Originally animists, conversion to the new faith may have led the Biates to abandon their age old practice of brewing rice beer which is still a practice among some of their neighboring brethren tribes.

Encouragingly, because of the relentless efforts of the Biate Devanpui (Biate Apex Body) and the Biate Cultural Organization, Assam (BCOA), the importance of the relics and the need for its preservation have been acknowledged, and hence as a result, Lungzubels around Khobak and its surrounding areas in Dima Hasao district are now being maintained and looked after by the Archaeological Dept. of the Department of Cultural Affairs, Assam. Moreover, with a view to promote tourism in the district as well as to showcase the Lungzubels to the world, Lungzubel festival was also organised by the Biate Cultural Organisation (BCO) of Assam, in collaboration with 22 Sector Assam Rifles, State Tourism Department and Archaeological Department and a Haflong-based NGO named Make a Difference (MaD) Society, on September 16, 2015 at Khobak where thousands of people from all spheres attended the day-long programme that included a pipe band display by the Assam Rifles and traditional dances performed by the local villagers belonging to the Biate community. The steps taken by the Assam Government has been commendable and the Lungzubels are now well looked after.
In the neighboring Meghalaya state, however, no concrete steps has been taken by the Government of Meghalaya to preserve the Lungzubels found in East Jaintia Hills district as of yet. They continue to be in a state of neglect.

Khobak is well connected by an all weather motorable road and one can visit the place at any time of the year. It is located about 130 km from Haflong.

James B. Dozier (Scout)

James Bell Dozier, also known as James Doshier, was born in Warren County, Tennessee on May 2 1820, and died in 1901.

He is one of only eight civilian recipients of the Medal of Honor. As a civilian scout during the Indian Wars., he received the award "for gallantry in action and on the march." This occurred in 1870 at the Little Wichita River in Texas during a battle with the Keechi.

In 1917, the U.S. Army—after Congress revised the standards for the award—removed from the rolls 911 medals previously awarded to civilians or for actions that would not warrant a Medal of Honor under the new higher standards. Dozier's medal was among those revoked. In 1977, Congress began reviewing numerous cases; it reinstated the medals for Dozier and four other civilian scouts on June 12, 1989.

400th Raider Infantry Battalion

The 400th Raider Infantry Battalion (Indonesian: "Yonif Raider 400/Banteng Raiders") is one of the 39 active Indonesian Army Raider Infantry Battalions. It was founded on 23 March 1953 and was transformed into its present form on 22 December 2002 - one of the first generation Raider Battalions to be raised. One of the "Banteng Raiders" honorific honors the battalion being raised in response towards the threat posed by the Darul Islam's armed wing, the "Tentara Islam Indonesia", in its area of operations as part of Kodam IV/Diponegoro territorial command, and its origins date back to 1950. It also took part in the events following the 1965 30 September Movement, wherein infantrymen from the Battalion were operationally deployed to Jakarta.

The battalion today is stationed in Semarang in Central Java.

In January 1950, the Darul Islam movement was beginning to threaten the peace in Central Java, just weeks after the Netherlands government awarded all its colonial processions to the United States of Indonesia, ending centuries of Dutch rule. To deal with the grave military situation in the province, given the worsening health of the then Commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces Sudirman, the then Chief of Staff of the Army, Col Abdul Harris Nasution, through the commanding general of the then 4th Territorial Command Diponegoro, Col Gatot Soebroto, began the process of creating a commando formation to deal with the increasing presence of the DI's military arm the "Tentara Islam Indonesia" (Islamic Army of Indonesia). Thus was born what would be the basis of the 400th Raider Infantry Battalion - the "National Freedom Bull Operational Command" ("Komando Gerakan Banteng Negara"), under Lt Col as its first commanding officer, who the following year was succeeded by future Chief of Staff of the Army, then Col Ahmad Yani and assisted by Lt Col Bachrum. The "Banteng Raiders", the military part of that operation, were raised as two independent special forces companies and a training company beginning in February 1950 in Tegal, Central Java.


To complement the Raider Companies, by the time the then "454th Infantry Battalion Banteng Raiders" was officially raised on 23 March 1953, 4 more companies were formed:


The battalion's actions from 1954 to 1958 against TII detachments operating in Central Java led to the end of the DI/TII threat to the citizens of the province, leading to the 1954 death of , the provincial DI/TII commander.

Ulmus glabra 'Nitida'

The wych elm cultivar Ulmus glabra 'Nitida' [:'shining', an allusion to the smooth upper surface of the leaves], the smooth glossy-leaved wych, was described by Fries from specimens collected by P. C. Afzelius in 1841 on the island of Stora Karlsö, Sweden, as "Ulmus montana nitida", in "Novitiae Florae Suecicae: continuatio, sistens Mantissam" III: 20 (1842). The "Novitiae Florae Gotlandicae" (1844) confirmed "U. montana" f. "nitida" as present on the islands of Stora Karlsö and neighbouring Lilla Karlsö off Gotland, Sweden, but did not report it from Gotland proper. A Stora Karlsö specimen from the Herbarium E. Fries is preserved in the Botanical Museum of Uppsala. The tree was listed by Rehder as "U. glabra" f. "nitida" (1915), a designation adopted by Krüssmann (1984), the latter copying Rehder's 'Norway' provenance error. 

A smooth-leaved wych occasionally appeared in collections outside Scandinavia. Syme in "English Botany; or, Coloured Figures of British Plants. Volume VIII" (1868) included an "U. montana" var. "nitida". 

Krüssmann described f. "nitida" as having "leaves smooth above" and glabrous young shoots. An 1895 herbarium specimen from Lilla Karlsö shows a typical wych leaf with a short petiole, and a samara with seed on stalk side of centre, a feature of unhybridised wych. 

Sowerby described var. "nitida" as having "all the essential characteristics of "U. montana"" [wych elm] but with leaves "shining and glabrous above". Ley (1910) noted that in the Kew specimen the samara was "rounder at the point than in the type", with the "notch distinct, its basal angle acute, reaching more than one-fifth [of the] way to [the] seed cavity". 

See under wych elm.

The tree was planted in the streets of Skanör, Sweden, in the 19th century. 'Nitida' was described by Rehder (1915) as a form present in Norway (probably an error for Sweden) "and perhaps also in England". It was cultivated at Kew in the early 20th century as "Ulmus scabra (glabra)", the smooth-leaved wych, where it was described by Ley (1910), who had not seen it growing naturally in England. He later, however, prepared a herbarium specimen of a similar wych elm from Edmondsham, Dorset. Elwes and Henry do not mention the Kew specimen in their 1913 work.

Arcadea is an American progressive synth metal band from Atlanta, GA., formed in 2015, by Mastodon drummer Brann Dailor, Zruda guitarist Core Atoms, and guitarist Raheem Amlani. Arcadea’s self-titled album was released on June 16, 2017, on Relapse Records.

Arcadea was founded in 2015, by upside-down guitarist Core Atoms and drummer Brann Dailor in Atlanta, Georgia. With the addition of guitarist Raheem Amlani, the three-piece began recording tracks at Amlani’s Orange Peel Studios in Atlanta, GA in 2015. The result was an 11-song album which was released on Relapse Records on June 16, 2017. Arcadea is the second music collaboration between Rochester, New York natives Atoms and Dailor who played in the progressive funk trio Gaylord, in the late 1990s.

For all three band members, Arcadea was a departure from previous music projects in both concept and sound. While Atoms is known for his unique guitar playing style, Arcadea’s premier album features no guitars—both Atoms and Amlani play only keyboards and synthesizers. For Dailor, it was an opportunity to sing lead vocals on the majority of songs in addition to drums. In an interview for Prog-Sphere Atoms explains, “Since we all have our own bands with more traditional instrumentation, we wanted to do something different but still rooted in our love of prog.”
Both Dailor and Atoms credit Stevie Wonder, early Genesis, and other 70s progressive rock as influences for Arcadea.

Marnie Oursler

Marnie Oursler (born 1979) is an American home builder and television personality who currently resides in Bethany Beach, Delaware. She has received a number of awards, including the Professional Builder Magazine's 40 Under 40 Award, Strong, Smart & Bold Award from Girls Inc. and Entrepreneur of the Year 2013 Stevie Award for Women in Business.

Following the success of her custom homebuilding business Marnie Custom Homes, Oursler's talents were picked up by DIY Network in 2015. The first season of her show, Big Beach Builds, aired in the Spring of 2016.

Marnie Oursler was born outside of Washington, D.C. in Prince George's County into a family of homebuilders. The tradition began with her great-great grandfather and has been passed down through five successive generations. Her father, Marvin Oursler, owns Marrick Homes in Frederick, Maryland. She attended Northern High School and graduated in 1996. During high school, Oursler spent her free time working at construction sites in the area with her uncles and her brother, Chris. She attended the Naval Academy for one year before transferring to East Carolina University, where she was on the softball team. She proceeded to get her Master's in Business Administration from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. Oursler grew up vacationing in Bethany Beach with her family. She loves building things for her niece and nephew and traveling internationally when she has time.

Oursler is the host of DIY Network's show Big Beach Builds. The first season aired in March of 2016 and the second season is airing in the Spring of 2018. On the show, Oursler makes fantasy beach homes on the coast of Delaware a reality by transforming dated houses into custom properties.

She was also the host of the HGTV Dream Home 2018 alongside fellow television personality Brian Patrick Flynn.

Oursler bought her first house at the age of 24 in Bethany Beach, Delaware for $240,000 - costing her all of her savings. She did anything she could to save money to pay for and renovate the house, picking up odd jobs along the way. Not able to afford help, she fixed up the run down home herself using the skills she had obtained from working with her family over the years. Nine months later, she sold the house for $340,000. Oursler used that money to buy a lot in a better location at the beach and began building another home. She lived in that house for two years before selling it and buying yet another lot, closer to the ocean, and building herself another home.

Realizing her talent and passion for the homebuilding business, Oursler began tracking real estate patterns in 2007. She then approached a couple that had previously asked her for a meeting about homebuilding at the beach. They agreed to let her be their homebuilder. She proceeded to quit her job as a real estate agent to start her own company, Marnie Custom Homes.

Church of St. Martin, Borschemich

The Church of St. Martin () was a Roman Catholic church in the village of , Erkelenz in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. It was built between 1906 and 1907 in the Gothic Revival style to designs of the architect . It took over the role from a medieval church which was located nearby, which was demolished upon completion of the new building.

The church was deconsecrated in 2014, and it was demolished in February 2016 as part of the destruction of the entire village of Borschemich in order to make way for the Garzweiler surface mine. A was built as its replacement in Neu-Borschemich between 2013 and 2015.

The Church of St. Martin was built between 1906 and 1907 according to designs of the architect and under the direction of the contractor Max Sauer. It was blessed on 27 October 1907 by dean Hermann Josef Kamp from Erkelenz, on behalf of the Archbishop of Cologne, Anton Hubert Fischer. The church was consecrated in honour of Saint Martin of Tours on 9 October 1915 by the auxiliary bishop .

The building took over the role of an earlier church, which was originally built in the 12th century, and was rebuilt in 1451 and renamed, extended and reconstructed in 1784. By the 19th century, the old church was insufficient, and it was demolished after the completion of the new church building

The church was built out of brick, and it had a single aisle with three bays in the nave, behind which was a triumphal arch and a choir. It had arched groin vaults. The three-storey bell tower was high, and it stood at the southern corner of the church. The building had a capacity of 150 people seated and 100 standing.

The church suffered some damage in 1945 during World War II, but it was repaired in 1950. A comprehensive renovation of both the exterior and interior was undertaken in 1982.

The village of Borschemich was on the planned route for the extension of the Garzweiler surface mine, a large lignite mine operated by the company RWE. The entire village was therefore demolished in the 2010s, with the company building a new settlement known as Neu-Borschemich as its replacement. RWE purchased the Church of St. Martin in 2013, and it was deconsecrated on 23 November 2014. The village's other major landmark, the , was demolished in 2015. Demolition of the church began at 10:00 am on 15 February 2016. The sacristy was demolished first, followed by the sanctuary. The tower was demolished a few days later.

Kėdainiai Hospital

Kėdainiai Hospital is one of the oldest hospitals in the region, providing general inpatient, outpatient, rehabilitation, medical nursing and support services for the residents of Kėdainiai district in Lithuania.

The first hospital in Kėdainiai was established in 1888 with an appointment of Ivanas Eustachovskis as the chief medical doctor. The hospital had 10 beds and was located in a rented house on Didžioji street. The initial tenancy agreement has been concluded for three years, then extended to 12 years at an annual rental fee of 300 rubles.

In 1897 the hospital was relocated to its own wooden building donated by Victoria Totleben in memory of her late husband general Eduard Totleben. Later, the same Victoria Totleben commissioned to build a new hospital built of brick, which opened in 1900 and was named Kėdainiai Eduard Totleben Village Hospital (today the building is occupied by a local Labour Exchange office). The hospital had 40 beds and its own electricity generator, as Kedainiai did not have a constant power supply at the time.

In 1937, now under the local government's initiative, a new 75-bed hospital worth 330,000 litas was built nearby and named the Hospital Palace. However, the joy was short-lived as it was demolished by retreating Nazi army in 1944. Rescued equipment was moved to the Village Hospital, which again served the main hospital's function.

Due to the shortage of beds and poor working conditions, the local government has repeatedly called the Lithuanian Ministers'
council asking for funds to rebuild the demolished hospital. Eventually, in 1965 a new 240-bed hospital was built in the new location where it remains today.

“These reports are not accurate,” Bluehole said via email, according to Polygon.com. “Tencent didn't make an investment.” Some rumors circulating suggested that Tencent intended to back Bluehole. The story was originally run by Yicaiglobal.com. The original story cited unnamed sources but was nonetheless picked up by a number of overseas online media outlets, which suggested that the organization may have some insider information.

In September 2017, Yicai Global was one of the first media organizations to publish reports that China’s central government said it does not support virtual currency transactions in China and planned to shutter all trading platforms, stirring market controversies and causing bitcoin prices to drop at one point.Some readers commented Yicai Global had killed bitcoin.

John Murray (abolitionist)

John Murray (1785–1849) was an abolitionist and social activist who served as Corresponding Secretary of the Glasgow Emancipation Society.

Born in Glasgow, he received a superior education but, following a pulmonary haemorrhage in his early twenties, went to the West Indies and found employment as a millwright at St Kitts. He remained there for several years, became acquainted with Dr William Stephen, a brother of William Wilberforce’s legal adviser James Stephen, and joined with him in protesting the mistreatment of slaves on the island. When Murray later laboured in the abolitionist cause, the Stephen connection fostered close co-operation between him and the Agency Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society led by George Stephen.

While in the West Indies, Murray became committed to what historian Duncan Rice has called ‘organizational radicalism’. He was convinced that slaveholding and patronage ‘were forms of property ownership distorted to a point that made them the symbolic antithesis of vital Christianity’.<br>

Returning to Scotland, he quickly identified himself with the abolitionist and other reform movements and became a member of the Glasgow Anti-Slavery Society on its formation in 1822. When that Society ceased to meet, following abolition of slavery in the British colonies, he called for establishment of a new association to work for the suppression of slavery worldwide.<br> 

His appeals led to the Glasgow Emancipation Society being formed in December 1833 with the Quaker tea merchant William Smeal and himself as its executive officers. The two men became ‘the soul of the Society’ and their conduct of its affairs was largely autonomous. Its object was the global abolition of slavery, and the Society was able to build on a vibrant local tradition of both abolitionism and benevolence.Their administrative efficiency was evidenced in 1838 when more than 100,000 signatures were collected for the Society’s petition demanding an end to the ‘apprenticeship’ of freed slaves in the West Indies — a powerful response by the Empire’s second city to Lord Melbourne’s negative stance at a meeting with Murray and other Glasgow delegates a few months earlier.

In 1840 Murray was a delegate to the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London; there his proposed scheme for protecting the African continent against slavery was tabled. Shortly afterwards a schism occurred in the Glasgow Society and, as part of the reordering of its affairs, Murray was appointed Corresponding Secretary while Smeal became Minutes Secretary and Treasurer. In practice, Murray may always have led the conduct of the Society’s communications. He ‘used more than one ream of paper for manuscripts upon the great cause which he seemed born to carry out’, supplying information and argument to other abolitionist organisations, arranging speaking engagements, preparing addresses and resolutions, and bombarding political leaders at home and abroad with reasoned protests and carefully formulated proposals.

From its birth, the Glasgow Emancipation Society prioritized pressing for British support for the abolitionist struggle in America. Murray identified himself with William Lloyd Garrison’s demands for immediate and unconditional freedom of slaves; he read Garrison’s ‘Appeal to the Friends of Negro Emancipation throughout Great Britain’ (August 1833) to the assembly that resolved to form the Society and later established a warm personal rapport with Garrison and other leaders of the American abolitionist cause who visited Glasgow, often accommodating them at his home and pressing his own money on them for travel expenses. Charles Lenox Remond reported being nursed through several days of fever in ‘the truly hospitable house of my dear friend John Murray’. 

Among others from the American movement on familiar terms with Murray was Frederick Douglass, who described him as ‘the firm, the untiring, the devoted friend of the slave’ and captured the force of Murray’s commitment when recalling the campaign for the Free Church of Scotland to return American slaveowners’ donations: ‘While he lived that Church obtained no repose.’

From 1841 onwards the Glasgow Emancipation Society became increasingly militant not only in the abolitionist interest but across a range of issues dear to its officers, including international peace, constitutional reform and temperance. Murray was prominent in the Glasgow Anti-War Society, sat on the committee of the Glasgow Voluntary Society (committed to disestablishment of the Church), called for total abstinence, and was a delegate to the International Peace Congress at London in 1843 and Brussels in 1848. 

On returning from the West Indies he had set up as a spirit merchant but, becoming convinced of the evil of strong liquor, he gave up the trade and donated his stock to Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He opposed church use of fermented wine at Communion, brought this matter before the Relief Church session of which he was a member, and carried it onward to the Synod; defeated there, he was rebaptised into the Baptist church. Even by 1841 the wide-ranging radicalism of his views was observed by Nathaniel Peabody Rogers: ‘If there is a revolution in Scotland within twenty years, the name of John Murray will not be undistinguished in its history.’

Shortly after the death of Henry Clay in 1852, James McCune Smith compared the legacy of Clay’s forty years at the heart of American public life with the enduring achievements of John Murray. In favour of the latter, he declared, ‘I cannot help thinking how much more has been done for the cause of human progress by this faithful servant to his own convictions of the truth.’

Murray’s paternal family had intermarried with the influential Oswalds of Shieldhall, and he was able to engage the support of his kinsman James Oswald, MP for Glasgow, for some of the Society’s initiatives. Oswald later became one of the Society’s Vice-Presidents, and he was also instrumental in obtaining for Murray the position of Surveyor (later Collector) for the Forth and Clyde Canal Company; the appointment brought with it the house at Bowling Bay where Murray died, after successive attacks of paralysis, on 26 March 1849.

He left a widow, Anne, née Thomson (a committee member of the Glasgow Ladies’ Auxiliary Emancipation Society from its formation in 1834 until her death in 1850). The couple had two sons and a daughter. Each of the children was involved in their father’s work from an early age. The elder boy, James Oswald Murray (1823–70), arranged the printing of the French translation of Frederick Douglass’s Narrative in 1847, but was so impregnated with ‘the Garrison spirit’ that Elihu Burritt had to abandon plans to involve him in his peace campaign.

John Murray is not among those delegates portrayed in Benjamin Robert Haydon’s painting of the Anti-Slavery Convention of 1840, but Nathaniel Peabody Rogers’ physical description of him survives: ‘a noble, Robert-Bruce looking man... tall, gaunt, palpably made as the stranger beholds him for times of trouble and peril’.

San Gaggio, Florence

The Church of San Gaggio () is Roman Catholic church located on via Senese in Florence, Italy. It was once associated with a large convent.

An early church at the site was associated with the Patarines, and demolished by the followers of St Peter Martyr. Under the patronage of Donna Nera Manieri and the Corsini family, a church at the site was founded in the mid-14th century and dedicated to St Catherine "delle Ruote". In 1353, it was joined to an adjacent monastery of "Santa Caterina a Monte", and dedicated to "San Cajo" (Saint and Pope Caius). The name was corrupted to "San Gaggio". The church was subsequently heavily patronized by the Corsini family.

The interior has a chapel of St Andrea Corsini (1603), frescoed by the studio of Bernardino Poccetti and housing an "Annunciation with Saints" by the studio of Francesco Brina. The main altar was designed by Cigoli, who painted the oval fresco of the "Mystical Marriage of St Catherine" and the "Dispute of St Catherine". The 14th-century funeral monuments of the Corsini family, including Bartolommeo and Filippo, were moved to a chapel in the cloister of the church of Santo Spirito.

Edmond Lepelletier

Edmond Lepelletier (26 June 1846 – 22 July 1913) was a French journalist, a prolific popular novelist and a politician.
He is known for his lifelong friendship with Paul Verlaine.
He was initially a radical, fought for the Paris Commune, and wrote for republican journals.
Later he abandoned his friends and became nationalist and antisemitic.

Lepelletier was born on 26 June 1846 in Paris.
He was born in the Monceau district of Batignolles.
He received a classical education at the Lycée Bonaparte (now the Lycée Condorcet), then enrolled in the Faculty of Law, where he gained a Bachelor's degree.
He never pleaded as a lawyer, and later became a publicist.
He married, and was the father of the playwright Saint-Georges de Bouhélier and of the wife of René Viviani.
He fought 17 duels, was wounded, and only retained his limbs thanks to the surgeon Jules-Émile Péan.
He defended the surgeon obstinately when he was viciously attacked by the press.

Toward the end of the Second French Empire Lepelletier was condemned for attacks on Baron Haussmann, prefect of the Seine.
In the Sainte-Pélagie Prison he met Louis Charles Delescluze, later military commander of the Paris Commune, the writer Jules Vallès, Raoul Rigault and other future supporters of the Commune.
In 1867 he became a political journalist, writing in the "Nain Jaune" of Paris.
He contributed to the "Peuple souverain", "Suffrage universel", "Patriote français", "Rappel à l'homme libre", "Droits de l'homme", "Radical", "Marseillaise", "Mot d'ordre" and finally to "L'Écho de Paris".
Lepelletier became known for his novels, mainly drawn from dramatic works, including "Le Capitaine Angot" (1875), "Le chien du commissaire" (1876), "Ivan le nihiliste" (1880), "L'Amant de cœur" (1884) and "Laï-tou" (1885).
They were written with the same brisk, colorful style that was found in his political articles.

During the Franco-Prussian War (1870) Lepelletier enlisted in the 69th line regiment, then joined the 110th, and took part in the defense of Paris with his regiment.
He was a delegate to the Council of State of the Paris Commune.
For this, he was arrested after the Commune was repressed and held in preventative detention for a long time before being sentenced to one month's imprisonment.
He wrote later in his history of the Commune, "An idea germinated in the blood-soaked fields of Paris: Paris was to be free and autonomous, it was to practice the dictatorship of example, to serve as model for cities, provinces, states and kingdoms. Paris as a focal point of democracy and the center of social progress was, first of all, to become the capital of the united states of Europe and then to be the Rome of a universal federation of nations."
Lepelletier was a friend of Verlaine until his death, and wrote his biography.
Lepelletier recalled that Paul Verlaine (1844–96) was infatuated with Arthur Rimbaud, a very affected young man, and imposed him on all his friends.
In 1871, the day after Verlaine and Rimbaud had flaunted their relationship in the Odéon Theatre lobby, Lepelletier wrote in his gossip column that, "Paul Verlaine was arm-in-arm with a charming young lady, Mlle. Rimbaut."
At dinner a few days later Rimbaut threatened Lepelletier with a steak knife.
Lepelletier wrote that he threw the boy back into his chair, saying that in the recent war he had not been afraid of Prussians, and now he was not going to be bothered by a little troublemaker like Rimbaud.
He thought Verlaine's addiction to absinthe "undermined his moral and cerebral stamina, and eventually led to his social and even intellectual downfall."
He helped Verlaine in his last moments, and took care of his family.

Le Pelletier held very radical views, but they moderated when he began writing for "l'Echo de Paris".
For many years he was an active propagandist of Freemasonry, and held a high rank in this movement. 
In January 1882 he founded a Freemasons lodge, Les Droits de l'homme (Human Rights).
This quickly became one of the most brilliant and active lodges in the Grand Orient de France.
In 1888 he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour.
During a meeting of the Cirque d'Hiver in 1889 he laid the foundations for the great Republican Union movemebt that defeated Boulangism.

In the legislative elections of 4 October 1889 the Blanquists and Boulangists cooperated, dividing the electoral districts of Paris between the two parties.
Lepelletier ran as Republican candidate for the Seine for the 2nd constituency of the 17th arrondissement of Paris but was defeated in the first round by the Blanquist Ernest Roche, who won 8,953 votes against 7,758 for Lepelletier.
He was an anti-revoluationary candidate again in 1893 in the 2nd constituency of the 17th arondissement of Paris.
He was again defeated by Ernest Roche.
He was appointed a justice of the peace for the canton of Marly in 1889, but was dismissed in 1899.

In 1898 Lepelletier completely abandoned the Republican majority to join the Nationalists.
In 1899 he was President of the International Congress of the Press in Rome.
He resigned from Freemasonry, left his political friends and ran successfully in the 1900 Paris municipal election for the Batignolles district as an antisemtic candidate. 
As an editor at "l'Echo de Paris" he strongly opposed review of the Dreyfus trial.
In the municipal council of Paris and the Seine General Council he voted with the Nationalist majority.
On 11 May 1902 he ran for election as a Nationalist Republican in the 2nd constituency of the 17y arondissement of Paris, and was elected in the second round.
He was decisively defeated in the 1906 general elections,
He left office on 31 May 1906.

Lepelletier died on 22 July 1913 in Vittel, Vosges.

Thomas Worsley Staniforth

Thomas Worsley Staniforth (June 7, 1845 – March 25, 1909) was a British hymn writer.

Thomas was born in Sheffield, England to Thomas Staniforth, a Grinder and Cordelia Worsley. His family lived in the Wicker area of the city. Prior to becoming interested in music, Thomas worked as an Accounting clerk. By the time of the 1871 Census he had relocated to Brighton and is described as an Organist. Thomas primarily worked at St Paul's Church, Brighton as Organist and Choirmaster and later moved onto a position as music master at Highgate School in London.

On February 27, 1872, his hymn "O Thou Our Souls" was chosen to be performed at St. Paul's Cathedral during a thanksgiving service for the recover of then Prince of Wales Edward VII. Other notable hymns composed by Staniforth include "Jerusalem my happy home" and "St Paul" He was also a regular contributor to the Sheffield Telegraph for whom he wrote articles on church history and music.

Towards the end of the century he retired back to Sheffield. On October 5, 1898 he married Sarah Susannah Nicholson (Denton), a widower at the Wicker Parish church. He passed away on March 25, 1909 and his burial took place on the 29 March 1909 at City Road Cemetery.

Legacy sediment

Legacy sediment (LS) is the term used to describe depositional bodies of sediment inherited from the increase of human activities since the Neolithic . These include a broad range of land use and land cover changes, such as agricultural clearance , lumbering and clearance of native vegetation , mining , road building , urbanization , as well as alterations brought to river systems in the form of dams and other engineering structures meant to control and regulate natural fluvial processes (erosion, deposition, lateral migration, meandering) . The concept of LS is used in geomorphology, ecology, as well as in water quality and toxicological studies. 

LS is distributed in spatially heterogeneous ways throughout a landscape and accumulates to form various landforms. It can progress through the fluvial system through facies changes from hillslope colluvium, to floodplain and wetland alluvium, to fine-grained lacustrine and estuarine slackwater deposits . The temporal nature of LS is time-transgressive, meaning that initiation and peak rates of deposition can take place at different times within a fluvial system, as well as at different times between regions. The intermittent transport of LS can be thought of as a cascading system that reworks LS deposits from hillslopes, into channels and onto floodplains, such that anthropogenic sediment will be mixed with and non-anthropogenic sediment . 

River systems record past and present imprints of anthropogenically-forced changes to the environment. LS is an element of change in this context, as it drives fluxes of energy and matter (connectivity) through fluvial systems and provides indication of past land-uses and river dynamics that can inform future trajectories of river response. In this sense, acknowledging the concept of LS can benefit informed policy development in stream restorationn , water quality and sediment budget management, protection of aquatic ecosystems , and flood risk. Moreover, the implications of legacy effects associated with anthropogenically modified sediment dynamics are critical in the context of ecosystem services.

Definitions predominantly indicate post-settlement alluvium in North America created as a result of agricultural clearance. “Legacy Sediment (n.) Sediment that (1) was eroded from upland slopes during several centuries of intensive land clearing, agriculture, and milling (in the eastern U.S., this occurred from the late 17th to late 19th Centuries); (2) collected along stream corridors and valley bottoms, burying pre-settlement streams, floodplains, wetlands, and dry valleys; and that altered the hydrologic, biologic, aquatic, riparian, and chemical functions of pre-settlement streams and floodplains; (3) accumulated behind ubiquitous low-head mill dams in slackwater environments, resulting in thick accumulations of fine-grained sediment, which distinguishes ‘‘legacy sediment’’ from fluvial deposits associated with meandering streams; (4) can also accumulate as coarser grained, more poorly sorted colluvial (not associated with stream transport) deposits, usually at valley margins; (5) can contain varying amounts of total phosphorus and nitrogen, which contribute to nutrient loads in downstream waterways from bank erosion processes. . .’’ 

However, as a result of criticism related to the limited scope and applicability of this definition, a more flexible and generic definition that (1) includes a broader range of human activities, (2) considers more sediment types apart from post-settlement alluvium, (3) respects the spatial (nonuniform) and temporal (time-transgressive) variability of LS has been proposed. "Legacy sediment: Earth materials—primarily alluvium [or colluvium]—deposited following human disturbances such as deforestation, agricultural land use, or mining. The phrase is often used to describe post-European floodplain sediments, also known as post settlement alluvium. Awareness of legacy sediment has grown in response to the importance it plays in sediment budgets, water quality, river restoration, toxicity, lateral channel connectivity, and geomorphic theory. . .’’ "Legacy sediment is primarily alluvium [and colluvium] that was deposited following human disturbances in a watershed. The disturbance may have been in the form of deforestation, plowing agricultural land, mining, or other land-use changes. In North America and Australia, legacy sediments are ubiquitous and represent episodic erosion in response to the colonization of land by European settlers who introduced Old World land- clearance technologies (e.g. steel tools and plows pulled by draft animals) and export economies. In these settings, legacy sediments are often described as post-settlement alluvium (PSA), which may cover entire floodplains and bury the pre- settlement soil with a thick mantle of relatively young stratified sediment ." 

LS encompasses sediment of differing structures and textures. They can be colluvial, containing poorly sorted, angular rock fragments deposited by mass wasting or sheet erosional processes , alluvial, containing well sorted, rounded clasts and very-fine grained suspended sediment deposited by fluvial processes . 

Most LS is generated on highlands by erosional processes related to mass-wasting, sheet flow, rills and gullies. The deposited colluvium has a low travel distance and accumulates in midslope drapes near the site of erosion, in aprons or sediment wedges at the base of the slope or in fans at the mouth of gullies, debris flows and tributaries . 

Floodplains store alluvium through lateral and vertical accretion, i.e. bedload deposits are being incorporated into the floodplain. Depositional episodes reflect the balance between the amount of sediments available and the capacity for it to be transported. Accordingly, the nature of LS on floodplains can be of different nature : (1) graded, when an excess of sediment and a deficit in transport capacity buries floodplains in continuous deposits, (2) cascading, when abundant sediment and limited transport capacity results in a series of frequent, but separated pockets, (3) punctuated, when limited sediment supply but efficient transport leads to deposition only in locally isolated pockets.

In low energy environments like lakes, wetlands, estuaries, LS are dominated by very fine-grained material, such as silts and clays, and form beaches and beach-dune complexes . 

Another way to conceptualize the spatial pattern of LS throughout a watershed is through the notion of source and storage or sink zones . Stores differentiate themselves from sinks through their temporal persistence in the landscape, the first being temporary, while the second are more long-lasting . Highlands are characterized by local storage points near the sediment production zone, with larger storage spaces downstream in wider valleys with low gradients. Stores in this parts of a watershed have generally low residence times, as they are episodically reworked by the fluvial system. Sources are linked to sinks through transport or transfer zones, generally characterized by either high transport capacity or little accommodation space for sediment to accumulate in, e.g. steep narrow valleys that are highly effective in transferring sediment downstream. Sinks are most common in low-lying, low gradient areas where flow energy is dissipated across large surfaces, so that accumulation is dominant. Here, storage space and residence time of the deposits increases considerably relative to upstream parts of a watershed.

Scientific studies documenting the wide-spread alteration of sediment dynamics (i.e. sediment supply, sediment entrainment, transport, erosion, deposition and storage) by humans lead to the evidence that human activities have come to dominate erosional, depositional and geochemical processes in ecosystems . This is especially pronounced in river systems, given that rivers are the lowest topographic points of any landscape and consequently collect water, solutes, mineral sediment and particular organic matter from the landscape, but also precipitation, solutes and particulates from the atmosphere. Furthermore, increased sediment supply to rivers but reduced sediment transport within a fluvial network resulted in the creation of legacy effects along almost all rivers across the world. For example, even though accelerated anthropogenic soil erosion has increased sediment transport of rivers across the globe by 2.3 (± 0.6) billion metric tons per year, sediment delivery to the world's coasts and oceans has been reduced by 1.4 (± 0.3) billion metric tons per year because of retention within reservoirs . More than 50% of the major watersheds over the world are impacted by dams . In the United States alone, it is estimated that only 2% of river kilometers are not affected by dams . 

Human activities lead to legacy effects on river sediments, which manifest themselves as changes to the location, amount and composition of sediments. Legacy effects are temporally and spatially variable and the resulting sediment have varying spatial extents, accumulation rates and residence times within a river system. For example, removal of beaver dams may initially cause local sedimentation within a portion of basin that comprises solely a few hectares . Similarly, one milldam constructed within a river enhances deposition of sediment over several hectares . Conversely, construction of hundreds of kilometers of bank revetment structures, such as levees, has a much more extensive impact across a basin of nearly eliminating overbank sedimentation . Likewise, removal of native vegetation within an upland region of a basin may lead to significant aggradation of valley bottoms along almost the entire course of a river network . Wastewater treatment can remove contaminated sediment within less than a year , but heavy metals and synthetic chemicals may remain within river sediments at toxic standards for decades to centuries .

Three main effects of anthropogenic manipulation of ecosystems are to enhance sedimentation, to reduce or eliminate sedimentation and/or to contaminate sediments with various pollutants.

Sedimentation is enhanced by activities that either increase sediment supply to the river from upstream (e.g. agricultural clearing, mining, grazing) or other parts of the watershed or decrease the transport capacity of the river (e.g. flow regulation). 

The effects thereof may induce river metamorphosis, i.e. a whole-shift alteration of river morphology . For example, changing crops from grains to potatoes in late 19th century Poland resulted in such increased sediment yields, that meandering rivers metamorphosed into braided rivers . Copper mining in the headwaters of the Ok Tedi River in Papua New Guinea generated about 80 thousand tonnes per day of waste tailings and 121 thousand tonnes per day of mined wasted rock, which were discarded in the river and affected the entire course of the river network, as well as the nearshore environment . The river system responded by aggrading over 6 meters in parts of the basin a decade later . In California, the Bear River still continues to rework and move down sediment generated by mining activities more than a century after these stopped . 

Indirectly, climate change can also enhance sedimentation through changes in precipitation and discharge patterns, which have been shown to result in increased mass movements , alterations of wildfire regimes and increased glacial melting .

Sedimentation is reduced or removed altogether when human activities reduce sediment yields from upstream (e.g. dams and reservoirs within upland regions, sediment detention basins) or reduce the river channel's physical complexity (e.g. channelization, drainage) or disconnect river channels from adjacent floodplains and wetlands (e.g. levees, removal of beaver dams and logjams/large woody debris) . 

Rapid dam construction in the Mekong River system resulted in 38 dams (as of 2014) and an additional 133 proposed for the main stream and its tributary streams - if all of these were to be constructed, the overall sediment trapping capacity would be 96% . Estimates show that about 100 billion metric tons of sediment are presently stored in reservoirs that have been constructed over the past 50 years . Levee construction in the lower Mississippi River reduced overbank flows by 90%. Bank stabilization measures associated with this project reduced bank erosion and meander lateral migration, while dikes induced bed scour during low flows due to increased flow velocity. Overall, this project lead to a decrease of sediment storage on the floodplain from 89,600 to 7,000 square kilometers between 1882-2000 . In Australia's Cann River, wood removal from the channel transformed downstream segments of the river network from a sediment sink to a sediment source . 

Human activities introduce or concentrate naturally occurring (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus) or synthetic contaminants and pollutants that get absorbed in sediments and may lead, at toxic levels, to chronic or severe disruption of physiologic mechanisms in all organisms . The most common contaminants that can absorb fine sediment are trace metals, nutrients (e.g. nitrogen, phosphorus), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pathogens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) .

For instance, two tailing dams of gold mines located in Romanian tributaries of the Danube failed, thereby releasing vast amounts of cyanide-contaminated water and sediment for tens of kilometers downstream, which killed riverine organisms and affected human drinking-water supply for weeks . In the Rio San Juan basin of Peru, acid mine drainage was diverted into a natural lake, leading to extremely high concentrations copper, zinc and lead in the lake sediments . Samples taken by the USGS during 1993-2003 showed that median concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in agricultural streams are six times greater than background levels and that, across the US, concentrations in streams commonly lie above levels recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency in order to protect aquatic life .

Ignazio Florio Sr.

Ignazio Florio Sr. (Palermo, 16 December 1838 – Palermo, 17 May 1891) was an Italian entrepreneur and politician, member of the rich Florio economic dynasty, one of the wealthiest Italian families during the late 19th century.

The son of Vincenzo Florio Sr., the founder of the economic family dynasty, and of Giulia Portalupi, Ignazio was born in Palermo on 17 December 1838. After the death of his father, in 1868, he resolved the problems of the division of the inheritance that could have meant the liquidation of the flourishing enterprise. 

The other heirs, his sisters Giuseppina and Angelina, were not interested in the family businesses and preferred the payment of their parts. This required cash outflows of over 4 million lire, corresponding to more than a third of the value of all assets. Ignazio succeeded in dealing with the financial effort without affecting the productive activities. Free from constraints, he set about to consolidate and further develop the business empire.

In 1874, Ignazio Florio Sr. purchased the island of Favignana and the whole archipelago of the Aegadian Islands in order to expand the tuna business started by his family. Over time he brought the flotilla of the paternal shipping line "Societa in Accomandita Piroscafi Postali-Ignazio & Vicenzo Florio" (Florio Line) to a hundred units and in 1881 merged with the Rubattino company in Genoa, giving rise to the Navigazione Generale Italiana. At the time of the merger, the Florio Line was already a major company with a monopoly of the trade in the Mediterranean. "The New York Times" described the Florios as the "merchant princes of Europe". The Florio Line brought 50 ships into the merger, while Rubattino contributed 40.

He also considerably developed all the other industries founded by his father. In 1883 he was appointed Senator of the Kingdom of Italy, due to the fact that he had paid three thousand lire of direct taxation for three years because of his assets or industry. At his death in 1891 Ignazio Sr. left his two sons, Ignazio Florio Jr. and Vincenzo Florio, with assets valued at around 100 million lire.

Ignazio Jr. and his wife – baroness Giovanna D'Ondes Trigona – had three children:

Ecotive Metrocab

The Ecotive Metrocab (sometimes called New Metrocab), first presented in December 2013, is a completely new electrically powered taxicab manufactured by Ecotive, a subsidiary of Kamkorp. The vehicle is designed to comply with Transport for London’s taxi regulations, which, from 1 January 2018, ban new diesel-powered taxis and require zero-emissions capability.

The vehicle is electrically powered and has a 1.0-litre petrol engine to extend its range. It is the first authorised electric-powered London black cab. In March 2014 several vehicles were lent to taxi drivers for evaluation.

The Metrocab’s main competitor is the LEVC TX, another completely new electric taxi built to London’s 2018 regulations, and successor to the well-known TX4.

Prototypes were shown to the press in January 2014 and a “small fleet” of vehicles were running with the taxi operator ComCab in early 2015.

In May 2015 it was announced that, following a £50,000,000 investment, 3,500 Metrocab vehicles per year will be manufactured by Multimatic at an expanded plant in Tile Hill, Coventry.

The manufacturer claims fuel economy of 98 mpg (2.88 l/100 km) on the ECE101 cycle, a range of over 560 km, emissions of less than 65g/km CO per km. It has regenerative braking and can be recharged from a mains electric outlet, as well as by its own petrol engine. It has a turning circle of 7.62 m (London taxi regulations specify a maximum turning circle of 25 ft or 7.62 m). It has six passenger seats, with an optional 7th passenger seat in the front. Top speed is restricted to 80 mph. The lithium-ion polymer large format cells have a stored capacity of 12.2kWh.

Peak motor power is 2 x 50 kW. Peak wheel torque is 2 x 1,400Nm.

By 2015 London Taxi Company (LTC, now London EV Company), makers of the long-running TX4 taxi, were planning their own electric taxi, the TX5. In June 2015 LTC sued the makers of the Metrocab, claiming breach of trademark. A lawyer for LTC was quoted in the press as saying “It is actually all about the shape”.

In his January 2016 judgement, Mr Justice Arnold rejected all of LTC’s claims. He considered that “both LTC’s registered trade marks, which depict models of its taxis, were invalid and that even if LTC’s trade marks had been valid, they would not be infringed by the new Metrocab due to the low degree of similarity between the Metrocab and the LTC taxi”.

In November 2017 the judgement was confirmed at the Court of Appeal. A Metrocab spokesman said: “It is a great pity that unnecessary time has been wasted on a false accusation … We have continued to trial, improve and develop our technology over the last three years with taxi drivers in active service and are extremely proud of our decision to design and develop the entirety of the Metrocab here in the UK. We are looking forward to getting production up and running in Coventry following the court’s decision.”

Idaikaadar (Tamil: இடைக்காடர்) was a Tamil siddhar of the Sangam period. He authored verse 54 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai.

Unlike Idaikaadanar of the Sangam period, who was a poet by profession, Idaikaadar was a siddhar. Idaikaadar hailed from Idaikattur near Madurai. He is believed to have attained jeeva samadhi at Thiruvannamalai. He hosted navagrahas during a famine. A small navagraha temple remains at the site today at Idaikattur.

Verse 54 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai, an encomium written on Valluvar and the Kural literature, is attributed to Idaikaadar. The verse suggests, "Valluvar pierced a mustard and injected seven seas into it and compressed it into what we have today as Kural." It can be noted that Avvaiyar I fortified the meaning of this verse by replacing the first word "mustard" with the word "atom." He is one of the two contributors of the Tiruvalluva Maalai who have penned the verse in the Kural venba metre, the other one being Avvaiyar I.

George and Alfred

"George and Alfred" is a short story by P. G. Wodehouse and a Mr. Mulliner story. It was published in "Playboy" magazine in the US in January 1967. The story was also included in the 1966 collection "Plum Pie".

An earlier version of the story featured Reggie Pepper and was published as "Rallying Round Old George" in "The Strand Magazine" in December 1912. An American edition of this story was published in "Collier's Weekly" on 27 September 1913, titled "Brother Alfred".

In "George and Alfred", Mr. Mulliner goes to Monte Carlo, along with his nephew George, who gets into trouble after getting drunk. To help George, Mr. Mulliner comes up with an idea that takes advantage of the fact that George has a twin brother, Alfred.

At The Angler's Rest pub, the topic of twins arises, and Mr. Mulliner recounts the following story involving his nephews, the identical twins George and Alfred. Alfred is a magician in London professionally known as "The Great Alfredo", while George is a low-ranking scriptwriter in Hollywood, being essentially a yes-man to his boss Jacob Schnellenhamer. Mr. Mulliner befriends Schnellenhamer and sees George on Schnellenhamer's yacht heading to Monte Carlo. George is eager to collect an inheritance left to him by his godmother from his trustee, P. P. Bassinger, in Monaco.

At Monte Carlo, Mr. Mulliner is surprised to see Alfred, who is performing at the Casino. Mr. Mulliner tells Alfred that he is with the filmmaker Schnellenhamer. Alfred leaves for rehearsal before Mr. Mulliner can tell him that George has also come. Later, Schnellenhamer says that Sam Glutz, whom Schnellenhamer came to Monte Carlo to do business with, was mugged and knocked out near the Casino. He was found by a passer-by and taken to a hospital. Sergeant Brichoux of the Monaco police arrives, looking for George Mulliner. George's wallet was found near where Glutz was mugged. Concerned, Mr. Mulliner looks for George.

He finds George, who had been drinking because Bassinger gambled George's inheritance away and ran off to South America. George remarks that he dreamed he had brawled with someone. Mr. Mulliner concludes that George must have mugged Sam Glutz when drunk. He tells George to flee, but George's passport is on the yacht. George cannot get it while the police are around, and he says his uncle would never find it. George resigns himself to his fate, saying of life, "You can't win". Mr. Mulliner, hearing "twin", gets an idea: George will retrieve his passport pretending to be Alfred.

On the yacht, a man claiming to be Alfred shows up and pitches an idea to Schnellenhamer to include a magician in his next film. Mr. Mulliner realizes this is actually Alfred. Alfred goes further into the yacht to get materials to demonstrate his tricks, and then George appears, pretending to be Alfred. Sergeant Brichoux is about to arrest George when a bandaged man, Sam Glutz, approaches. Schnellenhamer tells him that they have the mugger, George, and that he has fired George. However, Sam reveals that George actually saved his life by fending off the mugger. Sam hires George and promises him a large salary. Sam, George and Mr. Mulliner leave to have lunch. Meanwhile, Alfred returns to demonstrate his tricks to Schnellenhamer.

There are many differences between the Mr. Mulliner and Reggie Pepper versions of the story. In the Reggie Pepper story, Reggie's friend George Lattaker kisses the maid Emma Pilbeam out of sheer joy when he gets engaged to Stella Vanderley, but Stella sees this and ends their engagement. (Voules, Reggie's valet, also ended his engagement to Emma after seeing George kiss her.) This induces George to drink, and he vaguely remembers getting into a brawl. Also, George is due to receive a legacy from his trustee, his uncle Augustus Arbutt, but is told that he must wait because a man is claiming to be George's long-lost twin brother Alfred.

The Prince of Saxburg-Liegnitz gets mugged near the Casino, and George is suspected. Reggie suggests that George pretend to be Alfred to avoid arrest. George discovers later that the uncle invented the twin brother to buy time to flee after gambling away George's money. Voules finds out about George pretending to be Alfred, and Reggie bribes him to remain silent. Count Fritz von Cöslin, the Prince's equerry, reveals that George saved the Prince's life. Voules suddenly appears, now wealthy and outspoken after a winning streak at the casino; seeking revenge on George for kissing Emma, he betrays George's identity, and is surprised when the Count wants to reward George. Voules reconciles with Emma. Reggie fires him, but Voules was planning to quit anyway.

The plots of the British and American editions of the Reggie Pepper story are essentially the same, though in the latter edition, Reggie Pepper and his friends are American rather than British. Reggie's valet Voules is still English; Reggie introduces him as "an Englishman who had spent most of his time valeting earls, and looked it".

The references to Hollywood in the Mulliner story "George and Alfred" were inspired by Wodehouse's experience as a scriptwriter in Hollywood in the 1930s.

The Reggie Pepper story "Rallying Round Old George", published in 1912 in the "Strand", credited both Wodehouse and Herbert Westbrook (who would collaborate with Wodehouse on the stage adaptation of the story) as authors. This story was illustrated by Charles Crombie. The American edition titled "Brother Alfred", which only credited Wodehouse as the author, was illustrated by Wallace Morgan in "Collier's". The Mulliner story "George and Alfred" was illustrated by Bill Charmatz in "Playboy".

"Rallying Round Old George" was collected in the American edition of "The Man with Two Left Feet" in 1917, and in the UK collection "My Man Jeeves" in 1919. "George and Alfred" was featured in the 1972 collection "The World of Mr. Mulliner", and in the 1985 collection of Hollywood-related Wodehouse stories, "The Hollywood Omnibus".

The British edition of the Reggie Pepper story was featured, under the American edition title "Brother Alfred", in the collection "Enter Jeeves", published in 1997 by Dover Publications. This collection includes all the Reggie Pepper stories and several early Jeeves stories.

The Reggie Pepper version of the story was adapted into a play titled "Brother Alfred", co-written by Wodehouse and Herbert Westbrook. The play, produced by and starring Lawrence Grossmith, was performed in April 1913 at the Savoy Theatre in London. The 1932 comedy film "Brother Alfred" was based on the play.

Frances Stephens (golfer)

Frances "Bunty" Stephens (married name Frances Stephens Smith or Frances Smith Stephens; 26 July 1924 – 23 July 1978) was an English amateur golfer.

Stephens was born in Lancashire where her father Fred was club professional at Bootle Golf Club. She faced discrimination from golf administrators because of his working class occupation. In 1955 she married Roy Smith, a Scottish Airlines pilot killed in a 1957 crash in Libya. They had one daughter. Stephens curtailed her playing career to raise her daughter, but subsequently was active in golf administration and developing junior golf. She was made OBE for "services to Ladies Golf" in the 1977 New Year Honours, a year before her death from cancer.

Stephens' home club was Royal Birkdale. She won the British Ladies Amateur Golf Championship in 1949 and 1954, and was runner-up in 1951 and 1952. She played in all six Curtis Cups from 1950 to 1960, and was non-playing captain of the Great Britain and Ireland team in 1962 and 1972. Her final-hole victories over Polly Riley in the 1956 and 1958 tournaments secured a win and a draw respectively for the British team, the first time it retained the cup. In the United States she was "hardly known", though she finished tied for 6th in the 1949 U.S. Women's Open Golf Championship. She was also a non-playing captain of the British team in the Vagliano Trophy.

Herbert Warren Wind called her a "slight, quiet, entirely undramatic girl" and an outstanding clutch player. Enid Wilson said she had "a very frail physique but ... the temperament of a tigress". Her swing had a pronounced hiatus at the top, which Wind called "most unimpressive", although Henry Cotton said she had "one of the prettiest swings in the game".

Perpetuum Immobile

Perpetuum Immobile is a solo piano album by Simon Nabatov. It was recorded in concert in 2000 and released by Leo Records.

The album of solo piano performances by Nabatov was recorded in concert at Loft, in Cologne, on 26 November 2000. The producers were Nabatov and Leo Feigin. All of the nine tracks were written by Nabatov. The pianist plays "One-handed Bandit" with his right hand only.

"Perpetuum Immobile" was released by Leo Records in January 2002. "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" wrote that "The influences on this solo recital come from the entire modern classical canon, and quite explicitly so." The AllMusic reviewer wrote: "Nabatov's solo piano work is entirely different than his ensemble recordings: Alone, he displays a strong romantic side that can be alternately dark and brooding or vigorously upbeat. His use of the pedals adds an atmospheric element that never devolves to mawkishness, but instead embraces life."

Martin Truex Jr. led the field to the green flag at 3:46 p.m., Winner of three consecutive Cup races, Kevin Harvick was shooting for a higher spot in history with a fourth Sunday, but that march ended early in the race when he collided with Kyle Larson on the backstretch, bringing out the first caution on lap 39, They were running side by side when Harvick appeared to move down the track and into the side of Larson’s car. The impact sent Harvick’s car into the outside wall, causing heavy damage.

The race restarted on lap 43.

Martin Truex Jr., master of stage wins last season, scored his first of the new year, leading Kyle Busch by 3.5 seconds. Also in the top 10 were Joey Logano, Brad Keselowski, Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Larson, Kurt Busch, Erik Jones, Clint Bowyer and Denny Hamlin, The second caution of the race flew on lap 62 for the conclusion of the first stage.

Martin Truex Jr., last year’s Cup champion, returned to victory lane — a place he visited eight times in 2017 — and, at the same time, dropped Kevin Harvick’s name from NASCAR’s marquee. At least temporarily.

“This is a reassurance that what we’re doing is working,” Truex said. “It just feels good to win. I don’t really worry about who’s winning or who else is fast. Obviously, the 4 (Harvick) has been quick and they have a great team. But, as we’ve seen today, we can put together a run like that, as well.

“It feels good to be able to find that speed.”

, provisional designation , is a dark and elongated asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 30 September 2014, by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer telescope (WISE) in Earth's orbit. Closely observed at Goldstone and Arecibo in February 2018, it has a rotation period of 8.7 hours.

 is a member of the Apollo asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. Apollo's are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known objects. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.90–1.70 AU once every 18 months (541 days; semi-major axis of 1.30 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.30 and an inclination of 30° with respect to the ecliptic. With an aphelion of 1.70 AU, it is also a Mars-crosser, as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666 AU. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation by WISE in September 2014.

As a potentially hazardous asteroid, has an minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) with Earth of less than 0.05 AU and a diameter of greater than 150 meters. The Earth-MOID is currently , which translates into 13.8 lunar distances (LD). 

On 7 February 2018 it passed from the Earth when its apparent magnitude brightened to 14. Goldstone observed it until the following day. While this was an 8.1-million kilometer flyby, the next close flyby of 6.3 million km will occur on 5 February 2058, and another 7.6 million km on 8 February 2095. It will also have a 3.2 million km flyby of Mars on 26 September 2048.

The asteroid's spectral type is unknown. Due to its unusually low albedo "(see below)" it is likely a carbonaceous C-type asteroid.

On 9 February, radiometric observations by the Arecibo Observatory revealed that the asteroid has an elongated, lumpy shape. The radar images also gave it a rotational period between 8 and 9 hours. A refined period of 8.7 hour agrees with (photometric) lightcurve observations by American photometrist Brian Warner at the Center for Solar System Studies () during 9–11 February 2018, who obtained a period of 8.729 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 0.93 magnitude, which also indicates an non-spheroidal shape ().

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, measures 0.971 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.068. During its close approach in February 2018, radiometric observations by Arecibo Observatory determined that the object is at least wide.

This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 4 November 2017 (). As of 2018, it has not been named.

Marthe Simard

Marthe Simard (1901-1993), born Marthe Caillaud in Bordj Menaïel, Algeria to French parents, was a French-Canadian activist and politician. She lived in Quebec after 1932, having gone there to follow her husband Dr. André Simard, grandson of former Quebec premier Félix-Gabriel Marchand. She was previously married at the age of nineteen, after which she had a baby girl and was then soon widowed.

After 1939 she organized material aid in medicines and food for the families of French soldiers. She also founded and became the chair of a committee of Free France founded to help French exiles and fight Vichy propaganda; it was the first committee of resistance outside France. She was inspired to found it by a speech made by Charles de Gaulle in 1940.

In 1944 Charles de Gaulle appointed a consultative assembly, which Marthe joined. On November 4 and 5, 1943, most major Quebec newspapers reported on the announcement of her appointment to the assembly. The presidents of the main French associations in Montréal published a letter in protest in 1943, protesting the fact that they were not consulted; however, as her committee of Free France pointed out, "they did not have to be by the orders of the Committee of the Liberation". 

She supported French women being given the right to vote, which occurred in 1944, claiming, "It is abnormal that the French woman, who has been for a long time intellectually (see the competitions of the universities!) And morally the equal of the man, remained the only one not to take part in political deliberations."

Though Charles de Gaulle asked her to remain in France and continue in politics, she went back to Quebec with her family.

She was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and was given the Resistance Medal and the Commemorative medal for voluntary service in Free France.

She is buried in Notre-Dame-de-Belmont Cemetery with her husband André. 

In 2008 a plaque was unveiled at 59 D'Auteuil street in Old Quebec, where she lived and founded her Free France committee, honoring her.

Major General Philip William Nuber (September 27, 1939 - May 21, 2003) of United States Air Force, was director of the Defense Mapping Agency from December 1994 to May 1996.

Nuber was born in Bozeman, Montana on September 27, 1939. He earned a BS degree in electrical engineering from Montana State University in 1962. Nuber graduated from the Air Command and Staff College in
1975 and the Industrial College of the Armed Forces the following year. He completed the University of Pittsburgh's Management Program for Executives in 1987 and Harvard University's National and International Security Management Course in 1991.

Nuber began active military service in March 1962, and earned his pilot wings in June 1963. His assignments included:

Nuber became director of the Defense Mapping Agency in December 1994, a post he held until May 1996. He brought the DMA to world attention when he provided the Global Geospatial Information System (GGIS) to President Clinton’s Dayton Peace Accord to settle the boundaries of Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia, and Kosovo. The leaders saw three-dimensional satellite imagery and mapping data of their nations, enabling them to quickly resolve boundary issues.

As director, Nuber oversaw the agency’s reinvention task force. Initiated by Nuber’s predecessor, Major General Raymund E. O'Mara, the task force sought to transform the DMA from a map provider to a timely source of geospatial information and services. It presented Nuber with a proposal for a completely restructured agency based on three groups: Operations, Acquisition and Technology, and Installation. He embraced and implemented the changes, profoundly changing the DMA and enhancing its talent and tradecraft. Nuber retired June 1, 1996; after 34 years of service.

Nuber died of cancer on May 21, 2003.

Nuber had more than 4,200 flying hours and was a veteran of three hundred combat missions. His 
military awards and decorations include:

Mason Weaver

Clarence "Mason" Weaver is a social critic, motivational speaker, commentator, and author. He is African American and Conservative. He wrote "It's OK to Leave the Plantation" which begins with an account of a speech given by the man credited with establishing the term lynching and argues against government dependence. Weaver has been a guest on various Conservative television programs.

In an interview with The Daily Caller, Weaver described his service in the U.S. Navy during the Vietnam War, and his membership in the Black Panthers as a "hate filled" youth at Berkeley.

Weaver changed his legal name to "Mason Weaver" in 1999. A former am radio talk show host, he had been using this name on air for several years. Fox News describes him as a former member of the Black Panther movement.

M. Christopher Brown II wrote about meeting Mason Weaver, exchanging ideas, and lessons he learned from Weaver in his 2007 book "Not Equal: Expanding Educational Opportunity in Society".

In his 1998 book "It's OK to Leave the Plantation," Weaver recounts his personal trajectory "from Berkeley militant to conservative businessman," and likens the contemporary dependence of significant numbers of African-Americans on government aid programs to slavery, complete with "overseers" and "drivers" of black citizens in the "mental plantation" of welfare programs.

Kimberley Wilson of Project 21 described it as "a remarkably hopeful book written by a man who has not only faced naked racism and discrimination, but also suffered greatly because of it."

Cal Poly student Steve Hinkle was punished for posting a flier on a public bulletin board announcing a College Republicans-sponsored talk by Weaver. The Cal Poly Judicial Affairs Office, after a seven-hour hearing in February 2003, found Hinkle guilty of "disruption of a campus event" and was sued by the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) and the ACLU. The case was settled.

2005 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 2005 UK & Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 80th year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

Westmead Hawk captured the public's imagination with his 'late charge' style of running and won the 2005 English Greyhound Derby. The Nick Savva trained greyhound was later voted as the Greyhound of the Year and Mark Wallis secured the Greyhound Trainer of the Year at the end of his maiden year as a trainer.

The 2005 Irish Greyhound Derby was considered to be one of the best in modern times with 'He Said So' winning the final that included Westmead Hawk, Droopys Marco and Irish Dog of the Year Droopys Maldini.

Gaming International/BS Group closed Milton Keynes Greyhound Stadium on Boxing Day despite earlier assurances that it would be rebuilt. The company had closed Bristol in 1997 in similar circumstances.

Charlie Lister stopped Brian Clemenson from winning a fourth consecutive Trainers Championship. Robbie De Niro and Ballymac Kewell made the Scottish Greyhound Derby final unbeaten before the latter was withdrawn leaving Robbie De Niro hot favourite but the final saw dual Irish Greyhound Derby finalist Droopys Marco trained by Frazer Black win the £25,000 first prize.

Mick Wheble former Group Racing Manager for Northern Sports was awarded an MBE for services to greyhound racing and charity during the Queen's 2005 Birthday Honours. 

Ernie Gaskin retired, with the kennels being taken over by his son Ernest Gaskin Jr. who retained the contract at Walthamstow Stadium, as did Mark Wallis who took over the Linda Jones Imperial Kennels. Linda was a two times champion trainer and had amassed 13 Category One successes before deciding to retire due to ill health.

<doc id="56569139" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56569139" title="Silberhütte (Braunlage)">
Silberhütte (Braunlage)

Silberhütte was once a village in the formerly free mining town of Sankt Andreasberg in the Harz mountains in Germany, but since its merger on 1 November 2011 it has been part of the borough of Braunlage. The name of the village goes back to the silver works that was existed here until 1912 and which smelted the ores from the mines around Sankt Andreasberg.

According to Ließmann (2003), the smelting of the ores was carried out here soon after the opening of the Sankt Andreasberg silver mines. These naturally had a raised arsenic content. The silver works was located at the confluence of the Wäschegrundbach and the Sperrlutter - so that there was enough water power to drive the machines in the smeltery. Not only did the smelting workers here have to endure toxic emissions but, even in older accounts, there is talk of the massive nuisance caused by toxic, arsenic-containing, fumes from the smeltery which, in unfavourable weather conditions, swept into the town and occasionally forced the people living there to flee.

The first smelting works are recorded at this locality around 1550. At the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, the smeltery was sold and demolished. When the silver mining industry flourished again in the 1680s, a new larger smelting works was built, which - rebuilt and extended several times - was in operation until 1912. 

In 1836, the responsible mining authority allowed the construction of a separate arsenic works on the Silberhütte site. In addition to arsenic trioxide, a toxic white powder, arsenic glass was also produced. Handling the powdery poison was very difficult. The workers were only sent into the chimneys to sweep the arsenic with a damp cloth in front of their faces - without a special bonus, hardly any worker was willing to sweep the arsenic dust. A contemporary report by master smelter, Seidensticker, stated that, "the arsenic trioxide produced cannot be weighed because this would cause disproportionately high costs and endanger workers' health more than the rest of the arsenic work put together." 

Around 1900, there were discussions about closing silver smeltery, but this was not carried out straight away out of consideration for its employees. After the Samson Pit had been taken out of service, ores from overseas were smelted until it was finally decommissioned in 1912. This delay was intended to cushion the loss of jobs in Sankt Andreasberg. The land and buildings were sold to wood-processing and other trades on the condition that it should create jobs. In the following years, however, it became clear that this requirement could not be fulfilled. Most of the silver smelting works were purchased by Rudolph Alberti, who temporarily operated the Harz "Glück Auf" factory at this location, but they were all shut down in 1929. That same year the timber works and crate factory, which had also been located on the site, closed.

During 1934m Federstahl AG Kassel bought the land and real estate of the "Glück Auf" works. In addition, further plots of land and real estate were purchased by Bauholzwerke und Kistenfabrik St. Andreasberg, the Prussian State Forestry Commission, the firm of C. F. Hertwig and Mr and Mrs Albrecht. In October that year, Federstahl AG Kassel moved its headquarters to Sankt Andreasberg and changed its name to Metallwerke Silberhütte. By November 1934, it announced it was starting work. At first, however, major construction work was necessary, which took more than a year; construction activity was brisk during autumn and winter 1935. The management's report for 1935 states that in Shed I, which was located on the site of the former "Glück Auf" works, hunting cartridges were to be produced and in Shed II, which was located on the premises of the former timber and box factory, steel boats were to be produced. Shed III, which was on land owned by C. F. Hertwig, was leased to[Schmiedag] in Hagen/Westphalia.

Production started in 1936. Shed I produced infantry ammunition for the standard Wehrmacht rifle, Shed II produced clips for rifle ammunition, and Shed III was leased to Vereinigte Gesenkschmiede (Schmiedag), which produced shell cases for artillery ammunition.
In July 1935, 44 workers and employees were employed on converting existing buildings and constructing new ones. A year later, when production started, the number of employees had already risen to 143, and the number of employees continued to rise in the following years, from 336 in July 1937 to 348 in July and 348 in July. 
In 1938, 16,562,000 rounds of ammunitation were manufactured at Shed I, and in 1940 the factory was expanded with the addition of air-raid shelters and laboratory buildings.
In Shed II, where production also began in 1936, "strip-iron products" were manufactured from 1937 onwards, and there is no longer any indications of steel boat production. In 1938, 8,900,000 clips were produced. The company also invested in Shed II in 1940 by purchasing a low-voltage machine.

As the war started, production and weekly working hours increased and two-shift operation was introduced.
As a result of the war, production figures continued to rise, although the quantities demanded by the army were not attained, with the exception of a few months. The demand for labour increased, so that from 1942 onwards, Soviet forced labourers were employed. The production of the ammunition clips was moved to Shed I in order to erect RAD barracks on the site where the forced labourers were accommodated. In addition, residents of Sankt Andreasberg were required to work and skilled workers recruited by the Wehrmacht were recalled from duty.

On 1 April 1945, the workforce comprised 1,141 people, including 374 workers, 36 salaried employees and 731 foreigners. The village of Silberhütte was captured without a fight by the US Army on 14 April and the forced labourers were freed. However, shortly afterwards, they were interned again in the same camp as before and transported away on 20 June 1945. The facilities were plundered after 14 April 1945. The dismantling of the remaining facilities was completed by 1950. Afterwards, the properties were put to industrial re-use.

Until 1990, the Army Mountain Training Camp (AMTC) of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) was located on the site of Shed II. The camp offered space for a maximum of 200 people. Here, BAOR soldiers were trained in various skills such as skiing, mountaineering and climbing as well as survival techniques.

In 2004, a study by the Lower Saxony State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (LAVES) on heavy metal pollution in red deer and roe deer, found high concentrations of lead and cadmium in the area of the silver smelting works in their livers and kidneys and partly also in their muscles. However, the residues of arsenic, antimony and mercury in muscles and storage organs were only small. The levels of cadmium in the organs exceeded the residue levels of the EU's Contaminants Regulation, in some cases, considerably. However, this regulation does not apply to the meat and edible tissues of wild game. There are copies of the investigation report in the forest offices at Lauterberg and Riefensbeek. 

In 2005, the Lower Saxony Forestry Office in Lauterberg had around 6,000 tonnes of contaminated hazardous waste disposed of from the site above the Silberhütte - stockpile material from the smelting works and contaminated soils as well as residues from flue gas ducts and chimneys. The materials were highly contaminated with arsenic and heavy metals. The buildings had simply been destroyed after the closure of the hut and remained on site. Investigations of the site revealed that the area had to be cleaned. Excavators removed the contaminated material. Afterwards, the excavated area was covered with unpolluted soil and a loose layer of mountain meadow hay was laid out to prepare for reforestation. With this remediation, the district of Goslar as the licensing authority and the Lower Saxony Forestry Office of Lauterberg as the land owner also took precautions for water protection in the planned "Pöhlder Becken" water protection area.

SMS G196

SMS "G196" was a "S-138"-class large torpedo boat of the Imperial German Navy. She was built by the Germaniawerft shipyard at Kiel between 1910 and 1911, and was launched on 25 May 1911, entering service later that year. She served throughout the First World War, taking part in the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. She was renamed "T196" in February 1918.

Post war, "T196" served in the Weimar Republic's Reichsmarine, being rebuilt and modernised in 1923. She was still in service on the outbreak of the Second World War , taking part in the German Invasion of Poland at the start of the war and the evacuation of East Prussia towards the end of the war in Europe.

She survived the war, and was transferred to the Soviet Navy in 1945.

The Imperial German Navy ordered 12 large torpedo boats ("Große Torpedoboote") as part of the fiscal year 1910 shipbuilding programme, with one half-flotilla of six ships ordered from Germaniawerft and the other six ships from AG Vulcan. The two groups of torpedo boats were of basically similar layout but differed slightly in detailed design, with a gradual evolution of design and increase in displacement with each year's orders.

"G196" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load. 

Three coal-fired and one oil-fired water-tube boiler fed steam at a pressure of to two sets of direct-drive steam turbines. The ship's machinery was rated at giving a design speed of , with members of the class reaching a speed of during sea trials. 145 tons of coal and 76 tons of oil fuel were carried, giving an endurance of at , at or at . 

The ship was armed with two 8.8 cm L/45 guns, one on the forecastle and one aft. Four single 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes were fitted, with two on the ship's beam in the gap between the forecastle and the ship's bridge which were capable of firing straight ahead, one between the ship's two funnels, and one aft of the funnels. The ship had a crew of 84 officers and men.

"G196" was laid down at Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard as Yard number 156 and was launched on 25 May 1911 and completed on 2 October 1911.

The ship was extensively modified in 1923, with the forecastle being lengthened to behind the first funnel, the bridge structure and funnels being modified. The boilers were replaced by three oil-fired boilers, with power dropping to and speed to . Two 10.5 cm L/45 guns replaced the 8.8 cm guns, while the torpedo armament remained four 50 cm tubes, but arranged in two single and one twin mount. By the Second World War, her torpedo tubes had been removed, while two 20 mm anti-aircraft guns had been added.

On commissioning, "G196" joined the 2nd Half Flotilla of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, and remained part of the 2nd Half Flotilla in 1914.

On 28 August 1914, the British Harwich Force,supported by light cruisers and battlecruisers of the Grand Fleet, carried out a raid towards Heligoland with the intention of destroying patrolling German torpedo boats. The German defensive patrols around Heligoland consisted of one flotilla (the 1st Torpedo Flotilla) of 12 modern torpedo boats forming an outer patrol line about North and West of Heligoland, with an inner line of older torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division at about . Four German light cruisers and another flotilla of torpedo boats (the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) was in the vicinity of Heligoland. G196, a member of the 2nd Half Flotilla of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, formed part of the outer screen of torpedo boats. At about 06:00 on 28 August, , another member of the outer screen reported spotting the periscope of a submarine. As a result, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla was ordered out to hunt the hostile submarine. At 07:57 "G194" was fired on by British warships, and soon "G194" and "G196" were retreating towards Heligoland, pursued by four British destroyers. The 5th Flotilla and the old torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division also came under British fire, and were only saved by the intervention of the German cruisers and , with the torpedo boats , and "T111" damaged. The Torpedo boat , leader of the 1st Flotilla, trying to return to Heligoland on hearing gunfire, ran into the midst of the Harwich force and was sunk. The intervention of the supporting British forces resulted in the sinking of the German cruisers , and . The British light cruiser and destroyers , and were badly damaged but safely returned to base. "G196" was undamaged.

On 11 September 1915, the German cruisers and set out from Wilhelmshaven to lay a minefield off the Swarte Bank in the North Sea, with the High Seas Fleet sailing in support. On the return trip, the High Seas Fleet ran into a newly laid British minefield. "G196", which was off the port beam of the battleship , struck one of the mines and was badly damaged, being towed into port by another destroyer.

In 1918 "G196" joined an Escort Flotilla, and she was renamed "T196" on 22 February 1918.

After the end of the First World War, the scuttling of the German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919 and the Treaty of Versailles left Germany with a small navy of obsolete warships. The Versailles treaty limited the German Navy's torpedo forces to 16 destroyers and 16 torpedo boats, with only twelve of each in active service, with replacement of the existing ships not allowed until 15 years after they were launched. Replacements could not exceed 800 t displacement for destroyers and 200 t for torpedo boats. "T196" was retained as a destroyer under the treaty, and remained in active service in the new Reichsmarine. "T196" was modernised in 1923, but was still obsolete and in the 1930s was transferred to subsidiary roles, being used for training and as a Fleet Tender.

On the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939, "T196" was the flagship of the Officer Commanding Minesweepers and was deployed in support on the German Invasion of Poland. On 4 September "T196" along with the pre-dreadnought battleship and the old minesweeper "Von der Gronen" (formerly ), bombarded Westerplatte. 

In late January 1945, the Germans began a mass evacuation of soldiers and civilians from East Prussia and Danzig, which were threatened by the advance of Soviet forces. On 10 February "T196" and the torpedo recovery vessel "TF19" were escorting the liner "Steuben" from Pillau, when the Soviet submarine "S-13" torpedoed and sank "Steuben". Only about 300 of the more than 3000 aboard could be saved.

On 27 December 1945 "T196" was transferred to the Soviet Union as a War Prize. She is listed as being scrapped in 1949.

El Shafee Elsheikh

El Shafee Elsheikh (born July 16, 1988) is a British captive of the Syrian Democratic Forces, who said he was fleeing from the collapse of Daesh, the short-lived "Islamic State".

Born in Sudan, Elsheikh spent his youth in London, England. "The Daily Telegraph" reports he was a follower of a local football team, the Queen's Park Rangers, and dreamed of joining the team, when he grew up.

In 2014 and 2015 Daesh held dozens of European and North American captives, and the brutal conditions of their detention was widely reported. Four English speaking Daesh fighters played a central role in the brutality. Their identities were initially either not known. or security officials did not make their identities known to the public, so the press dubbed the four as the Jihadi Beatles, with the most well-known being known as Jihadi John. Later Elsheikh was reported to have been one of the other three Beatles. 

On March 30, 2017, Elsheikh and four other men were named as suspected terrorists, by the US State Department, under Executive Order 13224. This Executive Order signed by President George W. Bush, shortly after al Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001, allowed the State Department to bar US citizens, US financial institutions, and other US corporations, from having any financial transactions with designated individuals.

Syrian Democratic Forces captured Elsheikh, and his friend Alexanda Kotey, on January 24, 2018. The pair were reported to have been trying to blend in with genuine civilian refugees, fleeing the collapse of the last Daesh enclaves.

"The Independent" reported that the United Kingdom government was considering agreeing that Kotey and Elsheikh could be transferred to the Guantanamo detention camps.

Detention in Guantanamo could be indefinite detention, without charge, if transferred to US custody, for a civilian trial, they would likely be detained at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, if they were convicted. "The Independent" described how bleak conditions would be at the Florence Supermax, confinement to a featureless cell, for 23 hours a day, practically no human contact, exercise periods in a small featureless courtyard, near their cell.

Another option under consideration is trial at the International Court in the Hague. According to "The Independent", the UK government would first strip Kotey and Elsheikh of UK citizenship, prior to agreeing to transfer to the Hague.

"The Guardian" quoted Tobias Ellwood, the UK Minister of Defence, who argued that transfer to Guantanamo was inappropriate.

In a face-to-face interview with Jenan Moussa of Al Aan TV in Kobani, Syria, at the beginning of April 2018 Elsheikh said he was interviewed by US and Syrian Democratic Forces officials, but not by UK officials.

Central Women’s Sniper Training School

The Central Women’s Sniper Training School () was a Soviet military school for training female snipers for battle in the Second World War, more commonly referred to as the Great Patriotic War among Soviet Troops. Throughout the war the school trained 1061 snipers and 407 sniper instructors. The school yeilded several highly sucessful snipers who became decorated veterans, and two graduates were posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union.

The school was established in Veshnyaki, Moscow Oblast after an order issued on 20 March 1942 by the Soviet Commissariat of Defense to establish the school. Potential students had to be at least 20 years old, physically fit, graduated at least seven of their secondary school classes, and passed the initial 4-day Vsevobuch program. After a parade and swearing upon an oath the school was officially opened on 3 May.

In February 1943 students of the school donated 69,260 rubles of their combined savings to kickstart further rifle manufacturing. That same month a practice shooting range was opened in Kosino. In May the school officially became the Central Women’s Sniper Training School. On 25 June the school was ordered to form two battalions and a unit of sniper instructors after 50 graduates were sent to the Kalinin Front and another 54 sent to the Northwestern Front among the first batch of cadets. In July a second set of cadets swore their military oath and began their training. Cadets who passed the Moscow Higher Military Command School exam in addition to graduating achieved the rank of junior lieutenant. Of the March 1944 graduating class, 150 were sent to the Northwestern Front, 75 to the 2nd Baltic Front, 200 to the Western Front, 75 to the 1st Baltic Front, and 85 to the 1st Belorussian Front.

In May 1944 the third batch of cadets took their oath and began training. On 25 November 1944, 559 of the women left the academy for active duty before the rest of the remaining 411 students of their graduating class were deployed to the warfront in February. Those students included 95 sent to the 1st Belorussian Front, 87 sent to the 2nd Belorussian Front, 110 sent to the 1st Ukrainian Front, and 119 were sent to the 4th Ukrainian Front.

The school was disbanded from 15 March to 10 May 1945 while personnel were transferred to the Moscow Higher Military Command School.

Wellshill Cemetery

Wellshill Cemetery is a 19th century cemetery in northern Perth in Scotland. The cemetery is still operational and is under the control of Perth and Kinross Council.

In general the grounds are well-landscaped and well-maintained but with some minor vandalism in the central sections. Unlike many council cemeteries stones are not laid flat if considered dangerous but instead are marked with caution tapes.

The cemetery was opened in 1844 as a private cemetery. The original section and original entrance gates lie to the south-east.
A parochial (free section) was added to the north around 1860 and further private sections added to the west (now the centre)
and far north. A modern section was added by the Council on former Jeanfield recreation ground to the west, and is known as Jeanfield Cemetery.
A wall exists between the two cemeteries but the wall has a gap at each end for mutual access.

Modern access is from the south-west on Jeanfield Road. The feature nearest the modern entrance is the monument and attached graves of the 381 Polish pilots who died serving Britain during the Second World War. The cemetery also contains 573 Commonwealth war graves of persons who died of wounds, mainly at Perth Royal Infirmary.

The Polish code-breaker Lieutenant Colonel Gwido Langer was also originally buried here in 1948, as a Polish Signal Corps grave within the Polish war graves, but his body was exhumed in 2010 for reburial in Poland with full military honours.


The only grave of note (apart from war graves) in the Jeanfield section is the poet William Soutar (1898-1943)

MÁV Class V40

The MÁV Class V40 was an electric locomotive of the Hungarian State Railways (MÁV) and the first production electric locomotive using the Kandó system. It had a wheel arrangement of 1'D1' or 2-8-2 and a single traction motor driving through side rods.

Power for the electrification of railway traffic in Hungary could be extracted most economically from the nationwide 50 Hz electricity grid. Therefore, Kálmán Kandó developed his eponymous drive system, which is based on single-phase AC overhead lines and three-phase traction motors. The conversion of the current for the traction motor is provided by a rotary phase converter. The system was demonstrated on a test locomotive from 1923 and, from 1932 to 1935, the route from Budapest to Hegyeshalom was electrified at 16 kV, 50 Hz. The first electric locomotives on the line were of the MÁV V40 class. They were mixed-traffic locomotives with a top speed of 100 km/h. A total of 29 locomotives of this class were used on the said route. In the 1960s, the traction current system in Hungary was converted to 25 kV, 50 Hz and the Kandó locomotives were withdrawn.

V40.016 is preserved in the Hungarian Railway History Park, Budapest, after standing for years at Budapest East Railway Station.

The single-phase alternating current taken from the overhead line was converted into three-phase current by the phase converter and supplied to a single traction motor which was a 48-pole asynchronous motor. The phase converter provided four fixed speeds (25,50,75 and 100 km/h) and intermediate speeds were obtained using a liquid rheostat.

Final drive was through a Kandó triangle with one arm connected to an auxiliary idling shaft to minimise unwanted vertical forces. The locomotive was built on a rigid frame. Two of the driving axles had side play, which was controlled by Krauss-Helmholtz bogies.

The experimental Kandó locomotive was MÁV Class V50, built 1923. Its wheel arrangement was E or 0-10-0. A freight version of the Class V40 was also built. This was the Class V60, built 1932, which had a wheel arrangement of F or 0-12-0.

Stuart Turner (company)

Stuart Turner Ltd is a British engineering company, based in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, founded by engineer Sidney Marmaduke Stuart Turner in 1906.

Stuart Turner Ltd was incorporated in 1906 and started to produce model steam engines, gas engines for domestic electricity, lathes, etc. Stuart Turner went on to produce further model steam designs, and in 1906 there were nine models in the range. By 1907 more space was needed so premises were rented at Market Place in the centre of Henley-On-Thames, where the company remained for many years.

The 2-stroke engine with crankcase compression had been invented by Joseph Day in the mid-1890s. This made possible lightweight engines and new applications. Stuart Turner was exploring making small 2-strokes for motorcycles and generators. They secured the contract to make engines for the Dayton motorised bicycle made by Charles Day Manufacturing Co in Shoreditch, London, who were until then purely a bicycle manufacturer. This went on sale in late 1913. The engine has a one-piece cylinder and head with a rear-facing spark plug, and was of 162 cc, rated at 1.5 HP. The bore was 57 mm and the stroke 63.5 mm, and it had a U.H. magneto and Amac carburettor. Both single-speed and two-speed versions were available, and prices in July 1914 were 20 to 28 guineas according to specification.

Two employees, Alec Plint and W.G. Ayling, rode the Dayton bikes in motorcycle endurance events run by the Auto-Cycle Union (ACU), such as the six days trial. Weighing only 148 lb, these were usually the smallest motorcycles competing. These events included riding between and taking part in various tests, such as hill starts, acceleration and braking, cold starts, and climbing steep rough hills. Total distance for the 1914 event was 674 miles. The Daytons did well given that they were considered rather lacking in power as revealed by this excerpt from the Motor Cycle magazine of July 1914 – 'Ayling (Dayton) footed vigorously, but got his lilliputian engine to the top'. Production of engines for the Dayton was 20 engines per week, but production of the Dayton motorcycle ceased in 1915 due to the first World War.
In 1911, Stuart Turner was working on building a complete motorcycle, and they exhibited a single-cylinder motorcycle at the 1911 Olympia show (on the stand of R.G. Nye and Co of London). The engine was 299 cc with internal flywheels. In 1912 and 1913 they marketed the Stuart Stellar (some early references use 'Stella') motorcycle, this used an in-line two-cylinder water-cooled two-stroke engine complete with shaft drive. Engine capacity is variously quoted as 743 cc and 786 cc. This would be comparable with the Scott motorcycle of the time which had a transverse water cooled two-stroke twin-cylinder engine of 532 cc. However, in-spite of the innovative design, the Stellar was not a success and only 26 examples were built.

Many of the technical developments during this period appear to be down to Alec Plint, who is named as applicant on five Stuart Turner patents which include sealing crankcases, padding crankcases to improve compression, variable speed gears, and decompression devices. The 1911 patent diagrams show the current 2-stroke to be '2-port', i.e. with the inlet being by non-return valve into the transfer port, with ball races for the main bearings and deflector type piston. The inlet non-return valve is the subject of another Stuart Turner patent in 1911, naming Ernest Masters as co-applicant.

In 1914, the company manufactured a generating plant for the Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton's ship, the Endurance. It was used in the ill-fated Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition.

During World War I (1914–18), the company produced nuts and bolts, gas valves and a Klaxon horn for gas attack warnings. The workforce expanded to over 300 men and 100 women. In 1917, Stuart Turner acquired Broadgates Inn in Market Place, Henley-on-Thames, and has used this as a base ever since.

Shortly after the war, Stuart Turner introduced the P3 single-cylinder 2-stroke engine, designed by Alec Plint to drive lighting and pumping plants. This engine was to form the basis of a range of engines used for small power applications, particularly as marine engines and to drive generators, though also to drive equipment and pumps. Castings were produced in Stuart Turner's own foundry. The P4 superseded the P3 in 1928, and in 1930 the marine variant was introduced, and was sold in considerable number for fitment in small yachts and other pleasure boats. In around 1935/1936 the P4 was joined by the larger-bore P5 (268 cc) and twin-cylinder P55 (535 cc). While the P4 was made until the war, the P5 and P55 continued in production for over 30 years. For the marine engines, Stuart Turner produced a reversing gearbox and optional final drive reduction gear, and everything else up to and including the propellor was available. The many variations of the engines (marine and otherwise) were indicated by suffixes to the engine number; so, for example, a P55ME would be a marine P55 with electric start (Lucas Dynamotor, Siba Dynastart, or separate dynamo and starter).

Between 1932 and 1935, Stuart Turner produced the small (1/2 HP) type N engine, which had an overhung crank. This model seems to have been superseded by the type R 2-stroke engine, which was introduced in 1934 with a full width crank. The R2 being 84 cc, and the R3 having a larger bore size and hence 123 cc. These small engines were used for general utility, but also the R3M for pleasure boats, hire boats. The R3 was to continue in production until 1977.

The model engineering range was extensive throughout the inter-war years, with much production sold as kits of castings, though some complete engines were also sold. Most of the models were designed to be representative of a class of engine, mainly steam driven, rather than an accurate scale recreation of a specific engine. Internal combustion engines were also available as kits, including the 'lightweight' 2-stroke petrol engine. From 1935, Stuart Turner was also the United Kingdom agent for the American 'Brown Junior' 10 cc engine for which they developed an aluminium (elektron) airscrew. Some of the engines were intended to do a job of work rather than for the entertainment of a model engineer, for example, the 1935 Sandhurst horizontal 2/3 bhp engine, which was described thus: 'This engine will run on gas or petrol and is designed for continuous work such as dynamo, workshop or pump driving. It is supplied only as castings for the amateur to machine up.'. The larger steam engines, for example, the model 6A, are capable of 4 bhp and powering steam launches, thereby blurring the distinction between whether they were model engines, or designed to do a job of work, or both.

Many ancillaries were sold to illustrate the power from the model engines, such as the Avery Multipolar dynamo. In the 1906 catalogue, this dynamo (output of 20 volts, 4 amps at 1200 rpm) was said to have been "designed for use with a Stuart No2 engine". A variety of dynamos were sold over the years allowing them to be matched to the power of the model engine.

Stuart Turner also produced a wide range of boilers to power their steam engines, and sold matched boiler and steam engine as complete 'steam plants'. The most common boilers are the small 501 and 504 copper horizontal types used to drive the model steam engines, but they also produced a range of riveted steel vertical boilers up to 20 inches diameter, and 36 inches high, either with a central flue or with multiple tubes. They also offered brazing services for customers' boilers.

They also produced two complete model steamboats. The 24-inch Henley was produced from 1925, and had a single-cylinder S.T. oscillating steam engine, and the 39-inch Isis was launched the next year with a model 495 boiler and the twin-cylinder Star steam engine. These boats were produced until at least 1936, probably until the war disrupted matters. There was a version of the Henley steamboat powered by a Stuart Turner electric motor; this boat was sold as the 'Magician'. The 4-volt electric motor was also sold separately.

In 1923 the War Office invited Stuart Turner (and other firms) to design a very light air-cooled engine and generator for wireless. It was to be carried on a pack mule. The whole plant must not weigh more than 84 lb, it had to run in any temperature from freezing to 60 °C; it must not be affected by being carried upside down or in any position; it must govern within 5% and there were various other conditions. The result was that five firms produced engines but the Stuart Turner engine was the only one which fulfilled the requirements and passed the tests. This was the W.D. engine, which was a 4-stroke side-valve flat twin, and continued in production for 20 years. Two of these engines were taken on the 1933 Everest expedition to power the wireless sets.

From 1928 until the war, the company issued nine patents (again naming Alec Plint) for milking machines and developed a diaphragm pulsatory milking machine which was marketed by Gascoine of Reading, who later took over the rights. They also developed pumps, and in the 1933 Bond's catalogue a complete Stuart Turner electric motor and centrifugal pump on a baseplate with 180, 800, or 1120 gallons per hour was advertised. This evolved into the current product line of centrifugal pumps.

In 1932, Stuart Turner produced the model K 4-stroke engine, which was a single-cylinder overhead-valve engine designed to power refrigeration units. Only 64 were made, the last in 1938.

In 1934, Stuart Turner introduced the S type steam engine. This was not a model but a fully enclosed single-cylinder commercial power unit of 1 to 1.5 HP designed to drive generators or fans or pumps. It stood 22 inches tall with a 10-inch flywheel and weighed about 120 lb. Preston Services have stated that there were both slide valve and piston valve versions, only 247 were made between 1934 and 1962.

In 1938, Stuart Turner developed a single-cylinder 2-stroke diesel with crankcase compression, the model H. At the time this was the smallest commercial diesel engine in the world. These engines were sold mainly to the RNLI for charging batteries.

The company produced a number of products for the military during World War II (1939–45), including combined boiler, steam engine and generator plants, designed to be used by resistance fighters or troops operating covertly behind enemy lines to power radio transmitters. The first of these modest-sized steam generator plants was called the Firefly, and was based around the Stuart Sirius engine, later ones named Mk814 had a bespoke single-cylinder piston valve engine.

Stuart Turner also produced many internal combustion generators with uses such as charging aircraft batteries and providing dummy runway lights on fake airfields. Stuart Turner engines were built into the back of AEC fuel bowser trucks to drive a Zwicky Ltd pump to transfer fuel to aircraft. These P5XC engines were referred to in-house as the Zwicky engines.

Stuart Turner continued to make engines (especially marine engines), pumps, generators, and model kits throughout the post-war years, though several of the pre-war model internal combustion engines did not reappear.

The pre-war single-cylinder diesel engine was joined by a new twin-cylinder 2-stroke diesel in 1953, the H2/H2M/H2MR. Whereas the single had used crankcase compression to scavenge the cylinder, the twin-cylinder had two air pumps. Rated at 9 HP, the capacity was 780 cc, and weight 240 kg. The Single Cylinder Model H was updated to the H1, and many of its detail design features were changed, and ultimately it looked very much like a H2 minus a cylinder. Only 15 H1's were made. The single-cylinder diesel was phased out in 1960 and the twin in 1968, with only about 400 of each model produced.

A four-stroke twin-cylinder petrol engine (the 12HP ST4/ST4M/ST4MR/ST4RE) was introduced in May 1968. Rated at 12 HP, it was the most powerful engine in the range. This side-valve engine was 955 cc capacity and weighed 155 kg. Both hand-start and electric-start versions were produced, but production was only about 150 engines, and it was phased out in 1975.

In 1969, the P5 and the P55 twin were replaced by the more powerful 5 HP P6 and 10 HP P66 (both at the higher speed of 1650 rpm). There were a number of detailed differences, including a change to the ignition system, but the bore and stroke remained the same.

Stuart Turner marketed some small marine diesels from the Spanish marine engine company Solé as the Stuart Solé. Solé converts engines from a wide variety of manufacturers for marine use. From a 1977 Stuart Solé operators manual, it is known that Stuart Solé engines were available in 6 hp and 9 hp variants, which seem identical in appearance to the Solé Mini-1 and Mini-2 engines, based on Lombardini engines and made by Solé between 1974 and 1986. These were a common fitment in vessels made by the Cornish Crabbers boat-building company in the late 1970s and probably into the early 1980s, one 1981 example being listed for sale with an 11 hp Stuart Solé engine.

Stuart Turner ceased their marine engine production in 1978, and the spares and support were transferred to another company. In 1987, Stuart Turner Ltd acquired Morewood Model Engineers and the Stuart Model range moved to Cheddar in Somerset. Still branded as Stuart Models, it was a wholly owned subsidiary of Stuart Turner Ltd. Cheddar Models Ltd was formed as an offshoot from Stuart Models in the late 1980s. In 1991, the brand and range were sold to David Jones of Jones and Bradburn and it moved to Guernsey. When Cheddar Models went bankrupt in 2005 models and plans were absorbed back into the Stuart Model range. At some point, possibly as part of this reorganisation, Stuart Models had acquired the rights to the Plastow Traction Engine model range, which they sold in October 2006 to Bridport foundry of Dorset, who had been responsible for the castings. In July 2012 Stuart Models was bought by Bridport Foundry.

Stuart Turner Ltd continued making domestic water pumps staying at Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England.

Cape Bersen'yeva (Russian: "Mys Bersen'yeva") is a headland in Khabarovsk Krai, Russia.

The cape is on the northeastern side of Tugur Bay, 20 km (about 12 mi) to the west of Seneka Point. It is high and conspicuous, rising to a height of 162 m (531 ft). 

American whaleships frequented the waters off the cape between 1854 and 1885, anchoring off it and sending whaleboats down the bay for bowhead whales or sending boats to the cape itself to cruise for whales as well. Boat crews also camped at the cape. They called it Silas Richards Bluff, after the ship "Silas Richards", of New Bedford, which was wrecked in a bay near the cape on 13 July 1854. On 27 July 1867, the bark "Java", of New Bedford, was ordered out of Tugur Bay near the cape by a Russian man-of-war.

<doc id="56569607" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56569607" title="Cyclone Gita">
Cyclone Gita

Severe Tropical Cyclone Gita was the most intense tropical cyclone to impact Tonga since reliable records began. The second named storm and first major tropical cyclone of the 2017–18 South Pacific cyclone season, Gita originated from a monsoon trough that was active in the South Pacific in early February 2018. First classified as a tropical disturbance on 3 February, the nascent system meandered near Vanuatu for several days with little development. After acquiring a steady east trajectory near Fiji, it organized into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on 9 February near Samoa. Arcing south in a clockwise turn, the system rapidly intensified, and became a severe tropical cyclone on 10 February near Niue.

Throughout its path in the South Pacific, Cyclone Gita affected multiple island nations and territories. Tonga was the hardest-hit, with severe damage occurring on the islands of Tongatapu and ʻEua; two fatalities and forty-one injuries occurred in the kingdom. At least 171 homes were destroyed and more than 1,100 suffered damage. Violent winds destroyed homes and left the two islands largely without power. Torrential rains and damaging winds caused widespread disruptions in Samoa and American Samoa, prompting emergency declarations in both. Outlying islands in the Fijian Lau Islands were significantly affected, particularly Ono-i-Lau and Vatoa. Wallis and Futuna, Niue, and Vanuatu were also affected, but impacts in those areas were minor.

On 3 February, the Fiji Meteorological Service (FMS) started to monitor Tropical Disturbance 07F, which had developed within a trough of low pressure, about to the southeast of Honiara in the Solomon Islands.<ref name="TDS 03/02"></ref> The system was poorly organized and was located along an upper-level ridge of high pressure, in an area of high vertical wind shear. Over the next couple of days, the system moved erratically near northern Vanuatu and remained poorly organized, with atmospheric convection located to the south of the low-level circulation center.<ref name="TDS 05/02"></ref> The system subsequently started to move south-eastwards, towards the Fijian Islands and a favorable environment for further development, on 5 February. The system subsequently passed near the island nation during 8 February, where it developed into a tropical depression and started to move north-eastwards towards the Samoan Islands. During 9 February, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 09P, after an ASCAT image showed that it had winds of in its northern semicircle. The FMS subsequently named the system Tropical Cyclone Gita early, after the United States National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Pago Pago requested that the system be named early for warning and humanitarian reasons.<ref name="TDA 09/02"></ref>

After Gita was named, a prolonged period of rapid intensification ensued as it quickly intensified into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale, before it passed within of Samoa and American Samoa. After moving past the Samoan Islands, Gita turned southeast, then southwards, under the influence of a near-equatorial ridge to the northeast. On 10 February, Gita rapidly intensified to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale while traversing anomalously warm sea surface temperatures of between . On 11 February, Gita continued to intensify into a category 4 severe tropical cyclone. At the same time, Gita turned westward under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the south. At approximately 10:00 UTC (23:00 ) on 11 February, the cyclone passed about south of Tongatapu near its peak intensity, as a powerful Category 4 cyclone on both scales; the RSMC Nadi-based Australian scale and the JTWC-used Saffir–Simpson scale, with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 200 km/h (120 mph). At the same time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated peak 1-minute sustained winds at 230 km/h (145 mph). This made Gita the strongest cyclone to strike Tonga in its recorded history.
Gita impacted the Pacific island nations of Vanuatu, Fiji, Wallis and Futuna, Samoa, American Samoa, Niue and Tonga, with the most significant damage being reported in the Samoan Islands and Tonga. As Gita's precursor tropical disturbance impacted Vanuatu's Torba province during 6 February, the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department warned that heavy rainfall, thunder and lightning would impact the area and advised people to take extra precautions. Between 8 and 9 February, the system brought strong winds and heavy rain to Wallis and Futuna. Some power outages were reported on Wallis, though overall effects were negligible. During the cyclone's westward turn, it brought significant winds to Niue; however, no damage occurred.

Gita brought torrential rain to parts of Samoa on 8–9 February. Hardest hit were areas in and around Apia where more than of rain fell during the overnight hours. Multiple rivers in the city burst their banks and inundated homes. At least 233 people sought refuge in emergency shelters. Landslides and flooding rendered many roads impassable. Communications were briefly lost with the southern coast of Upolu. A state of disaster was declared for the nation on 10 February. Damage to the power grid reached $10 million.

In the two days preceding Gita's arrival, an associated monsoon trough produced significant rains, reaching across parts of American Samoa. Multiple streams flooded and prompted evacuations in Malaeloa village. Landslides were reported in Avau, Amanave, and Poloa. Cyclone Gita reached American Samoa on 9 February, bringing heavy rains and strong winds; homes were heavily damaged in the villages of Nu'uuli, Tafuna, and throughout the rest of Tutuila. High winds tore roofs of structures and downed trees and power lines. Approximately 90 percent of Tutuila was left without power and water. The local National Weather Service office in Pago Pago lost power; the Honolulu, Hawaii, office issued forecasts in the interim. Rainfall in Pago Pago exceeded . More than 800 people were displaced from their homes across the territory. Pago Pago International Airport suspended operations for the duration of the storm. Damage across the territory was estimated at US$10 million.

A Coast Guard AC-130 conducted aerial surveys of the territory and a small group of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) personnel were deployed.

Wied Scala

The" Wied-Scala" is an art-house cinema in Neitersen in the Westerwald region of Germany. It was first opened as a normal cinema in 1956. It takes its name from the river Wied, which flows immediately by the cinema building. The foyer of the cinema has a small café, which is supplemented in summer by a beer garden. The arena and balcony offer 110 seats. For events without seating, it can accommodate about 220 people. Since its reopening in 1988, the Wied Scala has established itself as a venue for culture and events covering for a wide variety of themes and, since 1989, it has been regularly received awards for an outstanding film programme at state and federal level. In recent years comprehensive modernisation measures have been carried out to upgrade the video and sound technology, as well as seating and fire protection, in order to cope with the rising demands on infrastructure and safety. In spite of these measures the cinema very largely retains its 1950's décor and original character.

A or B

"A or B" is a song recorded by Japanese singer Mika Nakashima. It was released as a single by Sony Music Associated Records on October 25, 2017. It was written and composed by Jam Note and arranged by Manaboon. The limited edition of the CD single comes with a DVD including the music video for "A or B" and its making-of. "A or B" was used in televised commercials for Kao's liquid fabric softener "Flair Fragrance", starring actress Satomi Ishihara.

"A or B" is the first single by Nakashima since the release of her eighth studio album, "Tough", and was released two months following the release of her cover album, "". The single's artwork depicts Nakashima on a white swing in front of a soft pink backdrop. The limited edition artwork has Nakashima in a similar position against a dark gray backdrop. The dueling visuals are meant to represent Nakashima swinging between options "A" and "B"; imagined here as the "rain" and "shine" dispositions of a woman in love.

"A or B" is a light soulful pop song, following in the same vein as her previous single "Koi o Suru". CDJournal praised Nakashima for her "unstrained and pleasant-sounding" vocal performance. CDJournal critics noted that with her last two singles, Nakashima has been successfully shedding her "diva" image.

"A or B" debuted at number 38 on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart. The single charted for two consecutive weeks and sold a reported total of 2,000 copies. The song also charted on "Billboard Japan"'s Top Singles Sales charts, also ranking at number 38.
