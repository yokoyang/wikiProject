Sophien Kamoun

"Sophien Kamoun" (born 8 December 1965) is a biologist. He is a Senior Scientist at The Sainsbury Laboratory and Professor of Biology at the University of East Anglia. Kamoun is known for contributions to our understanding of plant diseases and plant immunity. He received several awards and recognitions for his research, including the American Phytopathological Society Syngenta Award in 2003 and the Noel Keen Award in 2013, the Daiwa Adrian Prize in 2010, and the Kuwait Prize in 2016.

Sophien Kamoun grew up in Tunisia where he developed a passion and curiosity about nature. He studied at Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris, France, and then at the University of California at Davis where he was awarded a PhD in Genetics in 1991.

Kamoun is known for his seminal contributions to our understanding of plant diseases and plant immunity. He pioneered genomics and molecular biology methods to reveal fundamental insights into the biology and evolution of eukaryotic plant pathogens. He discovered virulence effector families from plant pathogens, and showed how they can modulate plant immunity. He demonstrated how antagonistic coevolution with host plants has impacted the architecture of pathogen genomes, accelerated the evolution of effector genes, and drove the emergence of immune receptors networks. His inventive work in plant pathology has resulted in new approaches to mitigate some of the world’s most serious crop diseases.

After his PhD, Kamoun worked at the NSF Center for Engineering Plants for Resistance Against Pathogens, University of California, Davis, and at the Department of Phytopathology, Wageningen University, Netherlands. He was on the faculty at the Ohio State University, Department of Plant Pathology, Wooster campus from 1998 to 2007, before joining The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich, United Kingdom, in 2007. He served as Head of The Sainsbury Laboratory from 2009 to 2014, and he also holds the rank of Professor of Biology at the University of East Anglia. Kamoun acted as President of the International Society for Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions (IS-MPMI) in 2012-2014.

Kamoun received several awards and recognitions. He received the American Phytopathological Society Syngenta Award in 2003 and the Noel Keen Award in 2013, the Daiwa Adrian Prize in 2010, and the Kuwait Prize in 2016. He was elected to Academia Europaea in 2011, EMBO in 2015, and has won successive European Research Council (ERC) Advanced Investigator grants in 2011 and 2017.

Reimund Bieringer

Reimund Bieringer (born 1957) is a German theologian, biblical scholar, Professor of New Testament Exegesis at the Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies, KU Leuven, Belgium, and a Roman Catholic priest of the Diocese of Speyer in Germany. The main areas of his research include the Second Letter to the Corinthians (exegesis and theology), the Gospel of John (Anti-Judaism and the Gospel of John; Mary Magdalene and the "Noli me tangere"), and biblical hermeneutics (normativity of the future). 

Bieringer first studied theology at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology, and then continued his studies at the Faculty of Theology of the KU Leuven, Belgium, where he defended his doctorate in 1986. His doctoral dissertation presents an exegesis of 2 Corinthians 5:14-21 in its epistolary context and is partially published in "Studies on 2 Corinthians".

In 1988 he was ordained a priest in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer, and served in a parish in Ludwigshafen as assistant priest until 1990, when he was appointed as a full-time staff member of the Faculty of Theology (now Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies) at KU Leuven. Between 2008 and 2012 he served as Vice-Dean for Research of that faculty. Since 2014 he has been the coordinator of the Biblical Studies Research Unit. He was also the co-founder and is currently the head of the Faculty’s Centre for Women’s Studies Theology. He also chairs the Research Group Exegesis, Hermeneutics and Theology of the Corpus Paulinum and Corpus Johanneum. Since 2011, he has been serving as the secretary of the "Colloquium Biblicum Lovaniense".

Between 2012 and 2015 Bieringer served as the President of the European Association of Biblical Studies and is currently the President of the . He is also the secretary of Colloquium Oecumenicum Paulinum, and in 2010 served as its President.

The theology and the background of Paul’s Second Letter to the Corinthians have belonged to Bieringer’s main research interests since the beginning of his academic career. He is known to be one of the long-standing defenders of the letter’s unity and integrity.

In his doctoral work, supervised by Jan Lambrecht, and in subsequent publications, he has argued that the genesis of Paul’s use of the concept of reconciliation in reference to the divine-human relationship in 2 Cor 5:14-21 is to be sought in Paul’s theological reflection on his personal experience of an initial reconciliation with the Corinthians. Bieringer has also suggested that, as opposed to the traditional understanding of καταλλάγητε ("katallagēte") in 2 Cor 5:20d as passive, the verb has here a reflexive meaning and thus could be translated as "reconcile yourselves to God" rather than "be reconciled to God".

In a paper presented at the 2008 Society of Biblical Literature Annual Meeting in Boston, Bieringer proposed the term “theology in the making” to refer to the process whereby Paul’s everyday life experiences and the resources at his disposal led to the development of Paul’s profound theological insights. This paper constituted also an introduction to the series of seminar sessions on Second Corinthians: Pauline Theology in the Making, to take place every year at the Society of Biblical Literature Annual Meetings, from 2008 to 2019. 

Some of Bieringer’s insights on reconciliation in 2 Corinthians were taken over and developed in a doctoral dissertation by Ivar Vegge, published subsequently in the WUNT series.

In 1996 Bieringer began to develop an eschatological-oriented biblical hermeneutics, which came to be known as the normativity of the future approach. In dialogue with the theologian Mary Elsbernd (1946-2010) from Loyola University (Chicago) and their respective students, they elaborated this approach in the publication "Normativity of the Future: Reading Biblical and Other Authoritative Texts in an Eschatological Perspective". The normativity of the future approach is rooted in a dialogical perspective on God's revelation, both through the Scriptures and the "signs of the times". Incorporating a variety of scholarly biblical methodologies, it focuses subsequently on the world behind, the world of, and especially the world before the text.

The approach traces the explicit or implicit eschatological vision(s) in a given biblical passage (such as the kingdom of God, the new heaven and the new earth, etc.) and seeks out the moral qualities of the text: its inclusive and exclusive dimensions, its pneumatological clues, its traces of the virtue of hope and its ethical demands. The normativity of the future approach also incorporates the hermeneutical meta-questions regarding the interpreter, the interpretive process and results, and their impact on communities, especially those who are oppressed.

To date, Bieringer continues to cultivate this approach, researching how Scriptures are used in various ways, such as in religious education in Australia and in interdisciplinary theologizing in a contextual manner.

In collaboration with Didier Pollefeyt, Reimund Bieringer further developed the normativity of the future approach in the context of Jewish-Christian dialogue. Their joint project on the alleged anti-Jewish tendencies in the Fourth Gospel (esp. in John 8:31-59) resulted in the Leuven colloquium on "Anti-Judaism and the Fourth Gospel in 2000" and has remained a research focus ever since. In 2016 their project in collaboration with Peter De Mey resulted in an expert seminar about "The Spirit, Hermeneutics and Dialogues" (Leuven, 25-27 May 2016).

Bieringer's research in John's Gospel and his use of a feminist lens in biblical studies paved the way for an interdisciplinary research project on John 20:1-17 entitled "Mary Magdalene and the Touching of Jesus. An Intra- and Interdisciplinary Investigation of the Interpretation of John 20:17 in Exegesis, Iconography and Pastoral Care, Research Foundation Flanders, 2005-2008." The research results were distributed through several articles and an edited volume on the topic, as well as radio interviews, lectures, debates and an exhibition on the image of Mary Magdalene and the iconography of the "Noli me tangere".

Bieringer’s research also focuses on the question of continuity and discontinuity between Judaism and Christianity in Paul’s time. The interdisciplinary project “New Perspectives on Paul and the Jews” investigated the role of Pauline theology in the process of Christian self-definition with respect to the Judaism of its time and dealt with the implications for present day Jewish-Christian dialogue.

Medi-Cal Access Program

The Medi-Cal Access Program (MCAP), formerly known as the Access for Infants and Mothers Program (AIM), is a California policy that grants access to Medi-Cal to pregnant and uninsured (or whose coverage contains a co-pay over $500) mothers who would otherwise not qualify due to exceeding income guidelines. The program covers mothers that make from 200-300% of the federal poverty level. In addition, all infants born from mothers enrolled in this program are qualified for the Medi-Cal Access Infant Program. 

The program is administered by the California Department of Health Care Services, and is paid for by the state of California and the federal government.
AIM was first introduced in 1992, and provided for 3,000-4,000 women annually initially. It is difficult to assess the impact of AIM as it was introduced alongside many other maternal healthcare improvement policies including increasing the eligibility limit for Medi-Cal from 110% to 200% of the federal poverty line, and extending Medi-Cal to undocumented foreign-born women. However, these programs were able to reduce the number of uninsured pregnant mothers from 13.2% in 1989 to under 3% in the mid 1990s.

David Henry Williams

David Henry Williams (July 6, 1814 – December 11, 1897) was a railroad surveyor, civil engineer and writer in civilian life. He was a volunteer in the United States Army during the Mexican-American War and a volunteer Union Army colonel during the American Civil War. He was appointed colonel of the 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment on July 23, 1861. He was appointed a brigadier general in the Union Army on November 29, 1862 but his appointment expired on March 4, 1863 without being confirmed by the United States Senate. His actual highest rank remained colonel. After the expiration of his appointment in 1863, Williams resigned from the Union Army and returned to his career as a civil engineer and, after his health soon declined, a writer for newspapers and magazines.

David Henry Williams was born in Otsego County, New York on March 19, 1819.

Williams moved to Detroit, Michigan in 1837. He was a railroad surveyor for 10 years.

Williams served as a volunteer in the Mexican-American War. Historian Ezra J. Warner wrote that Williams's obituary stated that he served in the Mexican-American War but he is not listed as an officer in F. B. Heitman's "Historical Register". Historian Stewart Sifakis wrote that Williams served "apparently as an enlisted man."

After the Mexican-American War, Williams moved to Allegheny, Pennsylvania, now part of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He practiced engineering and became interested in the militia.

The 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment was organized as the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment and served under that designation until the Battle of Fair Oaks. Thereafter, the 2nd Reserve Regiment was given the designation 31st Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment and the original regiment was renumbered as the 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment. Williams was the first colonel of the regiment, having been appointed July 23, 1861. 

Williams commanded the regiment during the Peninsula Campaign, where the unit was in action at the Siege of Yorktown and at the Seven Days Battles during which the regiment suffered heavy casualties at the Battle of Seven Pines and Battle of Malvern Hill. The regiment did not become engaged in heavy combat in the Maryland Campaign or the Battle of Fredericksburg and suffered few losses in them.

Williams was appointed a brigadier general on November 29, 1862. The appointment expired on March 4, 1863 without having been confirmed.

Warner notes that Williams's last appearance in the "Official Records" was January 31, 1863 when he was commander of the 82nd Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment in the division commanded by Charles Devens.

Williams resigned from the Union Army in early 1863 and returned to Allegheny (Pittsburgh).

Williams returned to engineering after he resigned from the Union Army. Warner states that he was a professor of engineering after his return to Allegheny. After a short time, his health deteriorated and he became a prolific writer for newspapers and magazines.

David Henry Williams died on June 1, 1891 at Allegheny, Pennsylvania. He is buried at Allegheny Cemetery, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

German-Mongolian Institute for Resources and Technology

The governments of Germany and Mongolia co-founded the German-Mongolian Institute for Resources and Technology (GMIT), based on an agreement which was signed in October 2011 by Mongolian President Tsakhjagiin Elbegdorj and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. GMIT started with its first 35 students in 2013 - on 20. June 2018 the first graduation of Bachelor students will take place. 

As a public (state-owned) university, GMIT has the objective to promote scientific teaching and research in the mining sector and the environmental sector, which are utterly important for the future of Mongolia.

Currently, GMIT offers four Bachelor study programs: B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering, B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering, B.Sc. in Environmental Engineering, and B.Sc. in Raw Materials & Process Engineering.
Furthermore, GMIT offers an Executive MBA degree in 'International Management of Resources and Environment' (the "green" MBA), which bridges the business-science-environment gap.The teaching of the Bachelor and Master's study programs is provided by German Experts, as well as by Mongolian Scientists, who obtained their Ph.D. abroad, in Germany or in USA.

The international character of the university is one of the core characteristics of GMIT, e.g. by using English as language of instruction and by awarding European Credit points. The other one is the extensive applied and interdisciplinary research in the field of Environmental Sciences, e.g. clean air, clean soil and clean water. Some of the research projects are: GLEAR - Clean Air for Gers, Integrated Water Resource Management, Further Development of Air Quality Monitoring in Ulaanbaatar, Environmental Impacts of Small Scale Mining in Nailakh, Optimization of the Value Chain for Polymineral Ores of Economically Strategic Metals, Thermal Coatings for Tribologically Highly Loaded Machine Parts or Sulfur Removal Process of Coal by Using an efficient Electromechanical Method. In 2018, GMIT expanded its research activities: In order to develop and support young researchers and scientists over the long-term, GMIT initiated a Strategic Research Development Fund.

The German-Mongolian Institute for Resources and Technology has a close cooperation with six German Universitiesas well as is supported by the Mongolian Ministry of Education, Culture, Science and Sports and by the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). The Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) are implementing partners.

The Gillespie Street-Clinton River Bridge is a bridge carrying Gillespie Street over the Clinton River in Pontiac, Michigan. It is a relatively early example of a rigid-frame bridge in Michigan. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

This bridge was apparently the first at this location. In 1936, the city of Pontiac deepened the Clinton River and extended Gillespie Street. They contracted with consulting engineer Harold Hawley Corson to design this bridge, who was serving as Birmingham's city engineer after a stint with the Michigan State Highway Department. Corson designed this rigid frame bridge, then a relatively new type of bridge which had been introduced in Michigan in the early 1930s.

The Gillespie Street bridge is a rigid-frame bridge with shallow spandrels ornamented with recessed panels. The bridge is 34 feet long, spanning a 33 foot-wide channel, and 50.5 feet wide. The railings are simple metal panels, ending in chain link fencing. The roadway is 36.5 feet wide, with sidewalks on each side.

Kokiri Tramway

The Kokiri Tramway was at least from 1895 to the 1902 a forest railway with a gauge of 1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in) near Kokiri on the Arnold River in the west of New Zealand's South Island .

William James Butler (born on 18 March 1858 at Leamington, Warwickshire, England; died on 10 December 1932 at Wellington) and his brother Joseph Butler (born on 1 March 1862 at Leamington]]; died on 30 September 1934 in London) had by 1892 become so wealthy that they could purchase a large saw mill at Kokiri, from which they began exporting to Australia. At Kokiri they pioneered the use of a steam-powered log hauler in New Zealand, and in 1895 introduced a steam locomotive running on a wooden tramway. The use of the steam hauler resulted in great economy in hauling heavy logs from the bush. In fact, so powerful was the steam hauler that timber, which at one time had to be left in the bush, was taken out with but little trouble.

Their well-known sawmill, which was one of the largest in Westland and ranked amongst the leading sawmill businesses in the South Island, was a very complete one, capable of turning out 40,000 feet of timber per week. The machinery was of the latest pattern, and had been imported from England and America. The mill was kept working full time around 1906, to supply a brisk trade in New Zealand and Australia. In the sister colonies the name of Butler Brothers has been familiar to all users of New Zealand timbers. The firm's bush in Westland covered an area of 2000 acres, and consisted principally of red, white and silver pine. It shipped white pine in large quantities direct to Melbourne, where it was used in the manufacture of butter boxes.

Acting on the advice of a Government expert, the firm at one time exported, with other merchants, large quantities of timber to London, but the results were not encouraging. Between thirty and forty men were constantly employed in connection with the mills of the Butler Brothers, who, while in Westland, gained a high reputation for bridge building. The brothers sold their Kokiri mill in 1902 and subsequently focussed on a new business that they had set up as the White Pine Company of New Zealand to mill kauri and kahikatea at Naumai on the Wairoa River, Northland, which they exported completely to Australia.

Gillian Laub (born 1975) is an American photographer and fllm maker based New York. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a degree in comparative literature before studying photography at the International Center of Photography. 

Gillian Laub was born in 1975 in Chappaqua, New York.
Laub is known for her documentary portraits of families, friends and strangers, which she describes as 'search of a deeper understanding of family and tribe in all its forms'. 

Her exhibition "Common Ground (Israelis and Palestinians)" placed Palestinian and Israeli children, families, and even soldiers next to each other, leaving the viewer wondering which person belongs to which culture. 

"An American Life" intimately documents Laub’s own family, portraying moments in various members of her extended family from Florida to New York City, as well as the Westchester suburbs. 

Laub’s "Dateline Israel" was shown at the Jewish Museum in New York City in 2007. That same year her first monograph "Testimony", which includes fifty portraits of Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs, displaced Lebanese families, and Palestinians, was published by Aperture, which also presented her with an Emerging Artist’s Award. “To consider these images is to be reminded not just of human cruelty and human stupidity but also of human tenacity.”

Laub’s work is contained in the collection of many museums, including the International Center of Photography, New York, NY, the Museum of Fine Art, Houston, TX, the Terrana Collection, Boston, MA, and the Jewish Museum, New York, NY, among others. She regularly photographs for "Time" and the "New York Times Magazine", among many other publications.

Laub is the recipient of the Aaron Siskind fellowship and Jerome Foundation Grant. She is represented by Benrubi Gallery. Laub's first feature - length documentary film, also titled Southern Rites, was released on HBO in Spring 2015.

Derby Street-Grand Trunk Western Railroad Bridge

The Derby Street-Grand Trunk Western Railroad Bridge is a bridge carrying Derby Street over the Grand Trunk Western Railroad in Birmingham, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

In the late 1910s, there was significant pressure to upgrade Woodward Avenue, a major artery carrying traffic from Detroit to Pontiac. In response, the road commissions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties and the affected municipalities created a regional master plan for improvements. In 1923, the state agreed to share in some of the cost of improving the infrastructure. The state led the effort to secure a right-of-way along the Woodward corridor; one of the major impediments was the existence of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad track paralleling Woodward.

After protracted legal wrangling, the railroad and the state came to an agreement, and the tracks were shifted to a new location. As part of the new construction, a series of bridges were designed by the railroad to carry street over the new tracks. Sixteen bridges, including this one carrying Derby Street, were built by A. Guthrie & Company of St. Paul, Minnesota in 1930. The bridge was extensively renovated in 1980, and still carries traffic. Further repair was completed in 2007.

The Derby Street Bridge is a five-span concrete T-beam bridge. It is 165 feet long with a 43.2-foot wide deck. It carries a 29.8-foot-wide roadway. The railings are solid concrete, ornamented with three recessed panels per span and curving outward at each end. The construction date, "1930," is inscribed in the concrete near the ends of the railings. The abutments, wing walls, and piers are all of concrete construction.

James Buchanan of Drumpellier (1726–1786) was an 18th century tobacco merchant who twice served as Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1768 to 1770 and 1774 to 1776.

He was born at Long Croft in Glasgow (now known as Virginia Street) in 1726 the son of Andrew Buchanan of Drumpellier and his wife Marion Montgomery. When James was a teenager his father served as Lord Provost of Glasgow.

Although he inherited his father's tobacco plantations and estates, including Drumpellier on his father's death in 1759, he was ruined in 1777 following the American Revolution. He sold the bulk of his estates to his cousin, Andrew Stirling (of William Stirling & Sons). The estate was reacquired by James' nephew, David Buchanan in 1808 (later known as David Buchanan Carrick.

In 1777 Buchanan Street in Glasgow was built on lands he inherited from his father, and is named after his family.

Around 1780 he seems to have relocated to Edinburgh. He is listed as a commissioner (probably working for the Excise in Leith Docks) and living in one of the larger houses on Leith Walk.

He died in Edinburgh on 3 January 1786. He is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard. The grave lies at the extreme north end near the Trotter mausoleum. Due to restrictions on stones in Greyfriars a slab was only placed in 1878 (by his grandson Carrick Buchanan).

He was married to Margaret Hamilton
grand-daughter of Thomas Hamilton, 6th Earl of Haddington.

Their only child, Helen Buchanan, married Vice Admiral Sir George Home of Blackadder, 7th Baronet.

Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner

Johann Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner (17 October 1728 – 4 June 1783) was a German polymath, promoting the Enlightenment in Bavaria. He worked as a civil servant for the Bavarian court, was a publisher of the journal "Churbaierischen Intelligenzblatt", and is known for writing hymns.

Born Johann Franz Seraph Kohlbrenner in Traunstein, he was the son of Rupert Kohlbrenner who was a worker in salt works. An accident in 1732 left him handicapped. After attending the local Volksschule, he worked as an assistant writer at the salt works. He was promoted to writer, responsible for the company's archive.

At age 25, he was called to Munich by Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria, to revise and supervise the Registratur der Hofkammer. In 1762, he installed a tree garden in the elector's Aerarium in Lechhausen. He influenced the schooling system, agriculture, singing in church, and new technical and medical developments.
In 1777, he published a hymnal in Landshut, together with the priest and composer , "Der heilige Gesang zum Gottesdienste in der römisch-katholischen Kirche. Erster Theil", which promoted liturgical singing in German. In 1783, he published the second part of the work in Salzburg. He wrote many of the song texts. Michael Haydn set some of these songs to music in 1795 in his "" (German High Mass).

Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner is stil known by his hymns which are frequently sung and appear in regional parts of the Catholic hymnal "Gotteslob" of 2013, including "Das Grab ist leer, der Held erwacht". His home town named a Hauptschule after him.

History and implementations of ZFS

The history and implementations of ZFS covers the development of the ZFS filing system.

ZFS began as part of the Sun Microsystems Solaris operating system in 2001. Large parts of Solaris - including ZFS - were published under an open source license as OpenSolaris for around 5 years from 2005, before being placed under a closed source license when Oracle Corporation acquired Sun in 2009/2010. During 2005 - 2010, the open source version of ZFS was ported to Linux, Mac OS X (continued as MacZFS) and FreeBSD. In 2010, the illumos project forked a recent version of OpenSolaris, to continue its development as an open source project, including ZFS. In 2013 the co-ordination of open source ZFS moved to an umbrella organization, OpenZFS, which allowed any person or organization that wished to use the open source version of ZFS, to collaborate in developing and maintaining a single common version of ZFS. illumos remains very closely involved with OpenZFS.

As of 2018, there are two main implementations of ZFS, both quite similar: Oracle's implementation, which is closed source and part of Solaris, and OpenZFS, which is widely used to provide ZFS on many unix-like operating systems.

In 1987, AT&T Corporation and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: Berkeley Software Distribution, UNIX System V, and Xenix. This became Unix System V Release 4 (SVR4). The project was released under the name Solaris, which became the successor to SunOS 4 (although SunOS 4.1."x" micro releases were retroactively named "Solaris 1"). 

ZFS was designed and implemented by a team at Sun led by Jeff Bonwick, Bill Moore and Matthew Ahrens. It was announced on September 14, 2004, but development started in 2001. Source code for ZFS was integrated into the main trunk of Solaris development on October 31, 2005, and released for developers as part of build 27 of OpenSolaris on November 16, 2005. In June 2006, Sun announced that ZFS was included in the mainstream 6/06 update to Solaris 10.

Historically, Solaris was developed as proprietary software. Sun Microsystems was a strong proponent of open source software. In June 2005, Sun released most of the codebase under the CDDL license, and founded the OpenSolaris open-source project. Sun was an early proponent of open source software, and with OpenSolaris, Sun wanted to build a developer and user community around the software. In Solaris 10 6/06 ("U2"), Sun added the ZFS file system. During the next 5 years (2006 to 2010), Sun frequently updated ZFS with new features, and ZFS was ported to Linux, Mac OS X (continued as MacZFS) and FreeBSD, under this open source license. 

The name at one point was said to stand for "Zettabyte File System", but by 2006 was no longer considered to be an abbreviation. A ZFS file system can store up to 256 quadrillion zettabytes (ZB).

In September 2007, NetApp sued Sun claiming that ZFS infringed some of NetApp's patents on Write Anywhere File Layout. Sun counter-sued in October the same year claiming the opposite. The lawsuits were ended in 2010 with an undisclosed settlement.

As the FSF claimed a CDDL and GPL legal incompatibility in 2005, Sun's implementation of the ZFS file system wasn't used as a basis for the development of a Linux kernel module, it wasn't merged into the Linux kernel mainline, and Linux distributions did not include it as a precompiled kernel module. As a workaround, FUSE, a framework that allows file systems to run in userspace, was used on Linux as a separation layer for which the licensing issues are not in effect, although with a set of its own issues that include performance penalty. However, the April 2016 release of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS includes CDDL-licensed ZFS on Linux as a kernel module that is maintained as a separate project, outside the Linux kernel mainline, claiming license compatibility.

In January 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired Sun Microsystems, and quickly discontinued the OpenSolaris distribution and the open source development model. In August 2010, Oracle discontinued providing public updates to the source code of the Solaris kernel, effectively turning Solaris 11 back into a closed source proprietary operating system.

In response to the changing landscape of Solaris and OpenSolaris, the illumos project was launched via webinar on Thursday, 3 August 2010, as a community effort of some core Solaris engineers to continue developing the open source version of Solaris, and complete the open sourcing of those parts not already open sourced by Sun. illumos was founded as a Foundation, the illumos Foundation, incorporated in the State of California as a 501(c)6 trade association. The original plan explicitly stated that illumos would not be a distribution or a fork. However, after Oracle announced discontinuing OpenSolaris, plans were made to fork the final version of the Solaris ON kernel allowing illumos to evolve into a kernel of its own. As part of OpenSolaris, an open source version of ZFS was therefore integral within illumos.

ZFS was widely used within numerous platforms, as well as Solaris. Therefore in 2013, the co-ordination of development work on the open source version of ZFS was passed to an umbrella project, "OpenZFS". The OpenZFS framework allows any interested parties to collaboratively develop the core ZFS codebase in common, while individually maintaining any specific extra code which ZFS requires to function and integrate within their own systems.


The following is a list of open-source ZFS ports and forks:


"Note: The Solaris version under development by Sun since the release of Solaris 10 in 2005 was codenamed 'Nevada', and was derived from what was the OpenSolaris codebase. 'Solaris Nevada' is the codename for the next-generation Solaris OS to eventually succeed Solaris 10 and this new code was then pulled successively into new OpenSolaris 'Nevada' snapshot builds. OpenSolaris is now discontinued and OpenIndiana forked from it.
A final build (b134) of OpenSolaris was published by Oracle (2010-Nov-12) as an upgrade path to Solaris 11 Express."

In OpenZFS, the pool version is permanently set to 5000, signifying that the pool indicates new features by setting or unsetting ZFS feature flags rather than by incrementing the pool version. The number 5000 was chosen because it is expected to never conflict with version numbers given by Oracle. Legacy version numbers still exist for pool versions 1–28.Future on-disk format changes are enabled / disabled independently via these feature flags.

In a 2016 AFP blog post, Marai described his fear of becoming a victim of a bombing, writing, "Every morning as I go to the office and every evening when I return home, all I think of are cars that can be booby-trapped, or of suicide bombers coming out of a crowd. I can’t take the risk. So we don’t go out."

Marai was amongst 25 killed (including 8 journalists) in the suicide bombings in Kabul on 30 April 2018 carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

"Our friend, the great photographer Shah Marai, is among the dead of the second Kabul explosion this morning. He was doing his job, like he had over two decades," wrote New York Times correspondent Mujib Mashal.“This is a devastating blow, for the brave staff of our close-knit Kabul bureau and the entire agency,” Agence France-Presse’s global news director Michele Leridon said. “We can only honor the strength, courage, and generosity of a photographer who covered often traumatic, horrific events with sensitivity and consummate professionalism.”

The is a curling club in Tokoro Town, Kitami City, Hokkaido Island, Japan. It is the home of the curling team, also known as the , a women's amateur curling team established in July 2010 by Olympian curler Mari Motohashi. The team is based in, and all the members are from Kitami City. The team got bronze medals at PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics.

Hokkaido Island, Japan and Alberta, Canada became sister province in 1980.
Then, curling was introduced to Tokoro Town as an outdoor recreation while farmers could not work in winter, and has been popular sport among people in Tokoro.
In 1981, lessons are held by former world champion curler Wally Ursuliak.
The administration of Tokoro town, later Kitami City, built public indoor curling facility in 1988, which is rebuilt as "" in 2013.
But major sponsor does not exist in Tokoro because it is a small local town. As the result, famous curlers born in Tokoro has gone to other prefectures in Japan.

Mari Motohashi, who was an Olympian at Trino 2006 and at Vancouver 2010 as a member of Team Aomori,
had also been one of such curlers. She thought why curlers born in Tokoro could not stay in the town. In the Summer of 2010, she asked two former curlers once retired, Megumi Mabuchi and Akane Eda, and two student curlers Yurika Yoshida
and Yumi Suzuki,
to join her rink named "Loco Solare," also known as "LS Kitami."
At the press conference in Tokyo on August 16 2010, she announced leaving Japanese national representative Team Aomori to establish her own rink in Tokoro. It was hard to find big sponsor in Kitami City, but small ones increased slowly. But in September 2013, Eda left the team because she could not kept the balance of curling and her work pastry chef.

In June 2014, Sochi 2014 Olympian as alternate; Chinami Yoshida
joined the team.
In the season of 2014-15, the team got their first winning prize at the World Curling Tour event; Avonair Cash Spiel. In May 2015, Satsuki Fujisawa
joined the team.

Ruth Wilkinson (née Webb, 8 February 1901 – 14 December 1985) was a community leader and local historian in New Zealand.

Wilkinson was born on 8 February 1901 in Rotorua, the youngest of five children of Mary Wilson and her husband, Seth Webb, a blacksmith. The family moved to Cambridge in 1908 and Wilkinson attended the local primary school, followed by Hamilton High School.

At the age of 16, Wilkinson began studying pharmacy by correspondence; her studies were interrupted by work assisting during the 1918 influenza epidemic and she passed her final examinations in 1921. Wilkinson married in 1923 and, as was expected at the time, gave up her career to be a housewife.

In 1947 Wilkinson's husband Kenneth was elected mayor of Cambridge, holding the position until 1953 and again from 1956 to 1962. Wilkinson supported him in his election campaigning and mayoral duties. In 1960 she became a justice of the peace and in 1963 she was appointed as an organiser of the Halls of Residence Campaign for the new University of Waikato.

Wilkinson was also a writer and local historian. In the 1920s and 1930s she wrote short stories on family life for the "New Zealand Herald" and the "Auckland Weekly News." She later wrote a number of works on the history of Cambridge. Wilkinson was awarded the Queen’s Service Medal for community service in 1985. She died in Cambridge on 14 December of the same year.

Mary Maud Page

Mary Maud Page (21 September 1867 London - 8 February 1925 Cape Town) was an English-born South African botanical illustrator. She was the daughter of Nathaniel Page, a former mayor of Croydon.

She studied painting, but due to failing eyesight changed to courses in wood-carving and metals and enamels, and became skilled in needlework, embroidery and lace-making. She also studied Braille in order to help a blind friend. When her father died and faced with her own failing health, she left for South Africa in July 1911. She settled in Dealesville in the Orange Free State at first, but soon moved to Bloemfontein in 1912. From there she visited Palapye and Pretoria, and toured Rhodesia and Basutoland, returning to the latter country a number of times. It was there that her interest in botany was born, starting a collection of plant specimens and helping a friend, Mrs Beaumont, to create a herbarium for use by the children of Morija. While visiting Cape Town in January 1915 she showed some flower illustrations to Louisa Bolus who was struck by their quality, and persuaded her to work at the Bolus Herbarium, an association which lasted until her death. 

Most of her illustrations dealt with Aizoaceae, but she also depicted Iridaceae and orchids. Many of her paintings appeared in Flowering Plants of Africa and were used in books by Hans Herre. A handbook on culinary herbs written by her was published by the Royal Horticultural Society. She was commemorated in the now defunct plant genus "Pagella" Schönland (1921), but also in "Conophytum pageae", "Nemesia pageae", "Crassula pageae", "Erica pageana", the former taxa "Psilocaulon pageae" (now "P. dinteri"), "Carpobrotus pageae" (now "C. mellei"), and "Erepsia pageae" (now "E. patula"), and possibly also for "Amphithalea pageae" and "Muraltia pageae".

Provancher Creek

Provancher Creek (French: “Ruisseau Provancher”) is a tributary of the upper part of the Mégiscane River located to the west of Gouin Reservoir, flowing entirely into forest area in the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.

The "Provancher Creek" flows in the Provancher and Poisson townships. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.

Route R2046 serves the lower eastern slope of the Provancher Creek and Larouche Lake Valley; that road is in turn eastbound to the 202 forest road which runs south to serve the peninsula where the village of Obedjiwan, Quebec is located.

The surface of "Provancher Creek" is usually frozen from mid-November to late April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March.

The hydrographic slopes adjacent to Provancher Creek are:

"Provancher Creek" originates at the mouth of Provancher Lake (length: ; altitude: ). The mouth of this head lake is located in Provancher Township, east of Médora and Chassigne lakes. This mouth is at:

From the mouth of the head lake, the course of the "Provancher Creek" flows entirely in the forest zone over mainly in Provancher Township, according to the following segments:

The mouth of the "Provancher Creek" merges with the "Rat Lake Water" which is crossed to the North by the Mégiscane River. This mouth is located at:

From the mouth of the Provancher Creek, the current flows over to Gouin Dam, according to the following segments:

From this dam, the current flows along the Saint-Maurice River to Trois-Rivières.

The terms "Provencher" and its derivative "Provancher" are family names of French origin.

The French toponym "ruisseau Provancher" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, e.g. at the creation of this commission.

Trowbridge Road-Grand Trunk Western Railroad Bridge

The Trowbridge Road-Grand Trunk Western Railroad Bridge is a bridge carrying Trowbridge Road over the Grand Trunk Western Railroad in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

In the late 1910s, there was significant pressure to upgrade Woodward Avenue, a major artery carrying traffic from Detroit to Pontiac. In response, the road commissions of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties and the affected municipalities created a regional master plan for improvements. In 1923, the state agreed to share in some of the cost of improving the infrastructure. The state led the effort to secure a right-of-way along the Woodward corridor; one of the major impediments was the existence of the Grand Trunk Western Railroad track paralleling Woodward.

After protracted legal wrangling, the railroad and the state came to an agreement, and the tracks were shifted to a new location. As part of the new construction, a series of bridges were designed by the railroad to carry street over the new tracks. Sixteen bridges were built by A. Guthrie & Company of St. Paul, Minnesota in 1930, but the Trowbridge Road bridge was not completed until 1931.

The Trowbridge Road bridge is a seven span, concrete T-beam structure. It is 231 feet long, with a 44-foot-wide deck carrying a 30-foot-wide roadway. It has false concrete arches with recessed panels in the spandrels. The railings are solid concrete parapets with paneled concrete posts and three recessed rectangular panels between each. The date "1930" is chiseled into the parapets at each end. The ends curve out before terminating in concrete posts, and chain-link fencing lines the inside of the railing.

St Leonard's Church, Heston

St Leonard's Church is the Church of England parish church for Heston in the London Borough of Hounslow. It dates from the 14th century, though there are records of a priest in Heston in the 7th century. The church tower survived the necessary rebuilding works in the 19th century, as did the lychgate. The grave of Private Frederick John White, who was flogged to death at Hounslow Barracks in 1846, can be found in the graveyard. The outcry at the manner of his death brought about a reduction in the maximum number of lashings that could be given as punishment, and eventually the banning of the practice altogether.

Naturalist Sir Joseph Banks (1743–1820) was laid to rest at St Leonard's Church.

It consists of meat such as pork, chicken, beef, and seafood stir fried with Thai holy basil and garlic. It is served with rice and topped up (optional) with fried egg or "Thai-Style Omelet" ("Khai Chiao"). The terms ‘stir fried’ and ‘Thai holy basil’ in Thai language are called "phat" and "ka phrao", respectively. The main seasonings are oyster sauce, soy sauce, cane sugar,"Thai fish sauce" (optional), and Bird's eye chili "(Capsicum annuum)".

William Henry Dodd (died 1881), "The Golden Dustman", raised the status of Thames bargemen, and aimed to improve the performance of the Thames sailing barges. 

1863, 1864 and 1865 saw the first Thames barge races. These continued unbroken until 1938. 
There were two classes, one for stumpies (under 80 tons) and one for heavier (under 100 tons) topsail barges. They were fiercely competitive – and soon new barges were being built, using the improved techniques learnt, just to win the next year's race. The Medway races started in 1880.

They were begun in 1863 by a wealthy owner called Henry Dodd. Dodd was a ploughboy from Hackney, London, who made his fortune carrying the city's waste to the country on the barges. He may well have been the model for Charles Dickens's character the Golden Dustman in "Our Mutual Friend". On his death in 1881, Dodd left £5000 for future match prizes.

Juba Petreius Hyphantes

Juba Petreius Hyphantes (Ancient Greek: , ca. 45 BC – ca. 40 AD) was a Roman playwright of Greek origins who wrote during the reign of emperors Augustus and Tiberius.

Little is known about his life, except what can be concluded from his name and works. The name Juba Petreius Hyphantes leads to assume that he was a Greek libertus from the clientele of praetor Marcus Petreius, a follower of Pompey the Great during the civil war, who committed suicide after the battle of Thapsus in 46 B.C., together with the Numidian king Juba I.

The works of Petreius Hyphantes had already fallen into oblivion in antiquity, but were rediscovered among the papyrus scrolls in the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum in Italy. Recently they have become readable thanks to the use of modern technology.

Hyphantes has written at least four plays, three tragedies and a satura, which form together the only complete tetralogy of ancient literature: ""Iubae Petreii Hyphantis tres tragoediae unaque satira"". All surviving plays deal with the history of Athens during the Peloponnesian War, in particular the dramatic trilogy (""De Meliis", "Ad Syracusam" "and" "Apud Arginusas""), while the fourth play (""Pro Socrate""), in Menippean satire style, contains more philosophical references with sarcastic comments on contemporary politics.

A first edition of his plays has been published in German translation. A scientific edition of the original text is still at work.

Barbecue in South Carolina

Barbecue is common currently and historically in the U.S. State of South Carolina. Throughout South Carolina, barbecue consists primarily of pulled pork. However, there are different variations within the state, mainly in the type of sauce that is used. There are four main sauces that are used in the state, mustard-based, tomato-based, vinegar-based and heavy tomato. While the styles differ regionally, most barbecue restaurants will have all four styles of sauce. On the other hand, a private cookout will still likely only have the sauce of its particular region. 

Mustard based sauce is common in the Midlands of South Carolina. It has a mustard base with vinegar, sugar and sometimes pepper or other ingredients. The sauce can be traced back to 18th century German settlers in the region.

"See Also: Barbecue in North Carolina"

Also known as "Eastern Style", it is the oldest style of barbecue in South Carolina. The sauce is made with vinegar and pepper and is common in the coastal regions of South Carolina.

"See Also: Barbecue in North Carolina"

Also known as "Lexington Style", it is made with tomatoes or ketchup, vinegar and pepper. It is common in the Pee Dee region as well as along the North Carolina border in the Northern parts of the state.

The Heavy tomato-based sauce is common in the upstate South Carolina, particular in the Northwestern corner and along the West. While the light tomato-based sauce is still mostly vinegar and pepper, the heavy tomato sauce is contains large amounts ketchup.

Laurence de Montmorency (1571-1654) was a French court official. She served as "Première dame d'honneur" to the queen of France, Anne of Austria, from 1615 until 1624. Until 1615, she shared her office with Inés de la Torre.

Laurence de Montmorency was the daughter of Claude de Clermont-Montoison, and married in 1601 to duke and Constable Henri I de Montmorency in his third marriage. She was widowed in 1614. 

In 1615, she was appointed Première dame d'honneur to the new queen of France, Anne of Austria, upon her arrival in France. However, when Anne arrived at the French royal court in Paris, a dilemma occurred, as she was given a new household composed of Frenchmen upon her arrival, but did not wish to dismiss her Spanish retinue. A compromise was met where she was allowed to keep both households. This resulted in a situation where several offices at her court was split, and the post of "Première dame d'honneur" was consequently shared by Laurence de Montmorency and her Spanish counterpart Inés de la Torre, just as the second rank office of "Dame d'atour" was shared between the Spanish Luisa de Osorio and her French counterpart Antoinette de Vernet. In 1618, Anne's Spanish courtiers where sent home and Laurence de Montmorency became her only Première dame d'honneur.

Elvira Amazar

Elvira Amazar (born 1890s - died February 7, 1971), sometimes seen as Vera Amazar or Elaine Amazar, was a Serbian-born Russian soprano singer and actress. She was also the subject of the first photograph described as "cheesecake", in 1917.

Elvira Amazar was born in Serbia. Her father was a mining engineer. She was orphaned as a small girl, when both parents died during a strike. Relatives in Poland took her in. She was educated in Germany and Moscow. She studied music in Paris and Milan. Among her teachers were Félia Litvinne and Umberto Masetti.

Amazar began her singing career in Russia, and found further success in Monte Carlo and Milan. She moved to the United States during World War I, a member of the Boston National Opera Company and a client of the Bel Canto Music Bureau. She sued her lover, baritone Georges Baklanoff, for an assault while they were on a Pacific Coast tour in 1917. They later reached a settlement.

Amazar appeared in three silent films, "The Volcano" (1919), "As a Man Thinks" (1919), and "L'Aviateur Masqué" (1922). She had a cabaret act in Paris in 1920.

In 1917 she appeared in Ziegfeld's "Follies of 1917". 1925, Amazar was in the cast of another revue, "Sinners of 1925", in New York. In 1927 and 1928, she was in the cast of "Blossom Time", an operetta based loosely on the life of composer Franz Schubert.

Amazar was known for wearing short skirts and high heels, and is often mentioned in connection with the term "cheesecake". As the story goes, in 1915, Amazar raised her skirt to show some of her bare leg for a photograph. The photographer was George Miller. Miller's editor liked the image enough to declare it "better than cheesecake," and the word "cheesecake" became a term for photographs of attractive young women baring some skin.

Elvira Almazar was involved with a married colleague, George Baklanoff, for several years. (His wife and children lived in Russia.) Her claims that he deceived her into traveling with him led to their arrests in Chicago, under the Mann Act, in 1920. The couple left for Paris soon after they were charged; Baklanoff was allowed to re-enter the United States in 1921, and the deportation orders were dropped by 1922. She became a citizen of the United States in 1929. 

She had a daughter, Tatiana Amazar (1911-1979), born in Russia, who became a cookbook author and food editor. Elvira Amazar died in New York City in 1971, in her seventies.

Chinese restaurant, Australia

At the beginning of the 21st century, Chinese restaurants have been present in a significant majority of Australian cities and towns for over fifty years, and in many places for over one hundred and fifty years.

They emerged as commercial enterprises on the Victorian gold fields.

Chinese food began to be established in Australia during the middle of the 19th century by Chinese indentured labourers on outback stations, many found work there as cooks and also in country pubs.

Chinese migration to Australia massively increased with the gold rushes during the 1850s, and some of these migrants opened food stores providing hot meals to Chinese gold diggers. European gold diggers also sometimes used these stores. They were referred to as "cookhouses", or as "cookshops", and were often associated with other Chinese businesses.

One third of all cooks in Australia were Chinese by 1890.

While Chinese migration to Australia essentially stopped from 1901 with the White Australia policy, chefs were granted exemptions and from 1934 Chinese traders with established businesses were able to bring non relative workers in from China. Family members were brought in under different names, were not trained cooks, and they had to learn on the job. Chinese restaurants were established in many country towns and all cities by the 1970s.

The oldest Chinese restaurant in Canberra opened in 1962, and was still operating in 2016.

The first documented Chinese restaurant in Australia was at Bakery Hill, Ballarat, on the Victorian goldfields, owned by Chin Thum Lok, opening in 1854. The restaurant did not serve Chinese style food, but instead provided English style food such as roast beef.

In Melbourne eighteen Chinese restaurants were listed in 1920, by 1939 eight had been established outside of the city's Chinatown precinct, and by 1970 there were one hundred and fifty operating throughout the city and suburbs.

The style of dish presented has changed over time.

In the 1960s and 1970s typical dishes were sweet and sour pork, or beef and black beans, with fried rice. In the 21st century many, more traditional, Chinese ingredients are used. Tofu was once unheard of, but now is readily accepted.

The majority of original Chinese migration came from Kwangtung Province in southern China, heavily influencing the style of food, consisting of fresh vegetables and fruit, with fish, poultry, and pork, with rice, herbs and spices.

4th North Midland Brigade, Royal Field Artillery

The 4th North Midland Brigade, sometimes known as the 'Derbyshire Howitzers', was a part-time unit of Britain's Royal Field Artillery created in 1908 as part of the Territorial Force. It served on the Western Front in World War I. Reorganised between the wars, it later converted to the anti-aircraft (AA) role. During World War II part of the regiment served in the Siege of Malta but the rest was captured at the Fall of Tobruk. The reconstituted regiment served on in Anti-Aircraft Command until 1955 and as a unit of the Royal Engineers until 1967.

When the Territorial Force (TF) was created from the former Volunteer Force by the Haldane Reforms in 1908, it was organised into regional infantry divisions, each with a full establishment of Royal Field Artillery (RFA) brigades. Where there were no suitable artillery volunteer units in the region, these brigades had to be created from scratch. This was the case for the North Midland Division, for which a new Howitzer brigade was raised in Derbyshire with the following composition: 

IV North Midland (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA

The new brigade established its headquarters (HQ) at 91 Siddals Road in Derby, which it shared with C and D Squadrons of the Derbyshire Imperial Yeomanry. The first Commanding Officer (CO), appointed on 1 April was Lieutenant-Colonel Harry Chandos-Pole-Gell of Hopton Hall, previously a Major in the Derbyshire Imperial Yeomanry. Most of the other officers were appointed on 6 August: the Officer Commanding (OC) of 1st Derby Bty was Major Lionel Guy Gisborne of Allestree Hall, who had seen service in the Second Boer War as a captain in the Derbyshire Imperial Yeomanry. Among the officers appointed to 1st Derby Bty were three Derbyshire County Cricket Club players: George Walkden, Guy Wilson and Henry FitzHerbert Wright. Wright, who later became an MP, was commissioned as a captain, the other two as 2nd lieutenants. The OC of 2nd Derby Bty was William Drury Drury-Lowe, a former Captain in the Grenadier Guards.

Lieutenant-Colonel Chandos-Pole-Gell retired in 1913 and was appointed Honorary Colonel of the brigade; Major Gisborne was promoted to succeed him, and was in command on the outbreak of World War I.

The order to mobilise was received on 4 August 1914. Shortly afterwards, the men were invited to volunteer for overseas service, and the majority having accepted this liability, the North Midland Division concentrated at Luton. In November it moved to the area round Bishop's Stortford where it completed its war training. At the time of mobilisation, the two batteries of IV North Midland (H) Bde were each equipped with four BL 5-inch howitzers.

On 15 August 1914, the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. The floods of recruits coming forward were enrolled in these 2nd Line units. Lieutenant-Colonel Chandos-Pole-Gell was brought out of retirement to command the 2/1st Staffordshire Infantry Brigade during its first weeks of training.

The North Midland Division began embarking for France on 25 February 1915, and by 8 March had completed its concentration at Ploegsteert in Belgium – the first complete TF division to deploy to the Western Front with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It was numbered the 46th (North Midland) Division shortly afterwards.

Over the following months the artillery supported the infantry in routine trench warfare in the Ypres Salient. On 19 July the Royal Engineers exploded a mine under the German positions at Hooge, but the infantry of 3rd Division tasked with seizing the crater had not been given a supporting artillery fireplan. As the infantry were being driven out by German artillery, counter-battery fire from 46th Division's guns and other neighbouring artillery helped to rectify the situation. When the Germans attacked the Hooge crater with flamethrowers on 30 July, 139th (Sherwood Foresters) Brigade of 46th Division was able to stabilise the line with the help of the divisional artillery.

46th Division's first offensive operation was the Battle of the Hohenzollern Redoubt. This was an attempt to restart the failed Battle of Loos, and the division was moved down from Ypres on 1 October for the purpose. The Germans recaptured the Hohenzollern trench system on 3 October, and the new attack was aimed at this point. The artillery bombardment (by the field guns of 46th and 28th Division, backed by heavy batteries) began at 12.00 on 13 October and the infantry went in at 14.00 behind a gas cloud. The attack was a disaster, most of the leading waves being cut down by machine gun and shell fire from German positions that had not been suppressed by the bombardment.

On 23 December the 46th (NM) Division was ordered to embark for Egypt. It entrained for Marseilles, and some of the infantry had actually reached Egypt before the order was rescinded on 21 January 1916. The artillery returned from Marseilles and the whole division reassembled on the Western Front near Amiens by 14 February.

1/IV (NM) Brigade rearmed with 4.5-inch howitzers on 16 December 1915. A (H) Battery from CLIV (Empire) Howitzer Bde, a Kitchener's Army unit recruited from Croydon, joined the brigade from 36th (Ulster) Division on 28 February 1916, and was designated R (H) Bty on 8 March. On 1 May the division was ordered into the line facing Gommecourt in preparation for the forthcoming Somme Offensive. Over the first 10 days of the month, the divisional artillery took over the existing battery positions along this front and began digging additional gun pits, observation posts (OPs) and dugouts to new designs.

While preparing for the offensive, the divisional artillery were subjected to a thorough reorganisation that was affecting all the field artillery in the BEF. First the TF brigades were assigned numbers, 1/IV North Midland becoming CCXXXIII (233), and the 1st and 2nd Derby Howitzer Btys becoming A (H) and B (H) Btys on 13 May. The other three North Midland brigades, now numbered CCXXX, CCXXXI and CCXXXII (230–2), each formed an additional D battery. On 23 May, CCXXXIII (H) Bde transferred A (H), R (H) and B (H) Btys to the other three brigades, and in exchange received each of the other brigades' D Btys equipped with 18-pounder field guns. As a result, CCXXX, CCXXXI, and CCXXXII brigades now had three 18-pounder batteries and one 4.5-inch howitzer battery, but CCXXXIII (despite being the original howitzer brigade) had three newly-formed 18-pounder batteries (A and B from Lincolnshire and C from Staffordshire) but no howitzers. In addition, the brigade ammunition columns (BACs) were abolished and merged into 46th Divisional Ammunition Column (DAC).

In June, Lt-Col Gisborne was awarded a CB and Major (acting Lt-Col) Drury-Lowe, commanding 2nd Derby Bty, received a DSO, but in July Drury-Lowe returned to the Grenadier Guards and reverted to his former rank of captain. He was killed in action in September 1916.

Preparations were under way for the 46th and 56th (1st London) Divisions to carry out an Attack on the Gommecourt Salient as a diversion from the main offensive further south. 46th Division would attack from the north west, converging with 56th from the south west. On 18 June, 46th Divisional artillery was allocated its tasks for wire-cutting and registration of targets ahead of the attack. It was divided into two groups: CCXXXIII Bde was grouped with CCXXX Bde on the right under the latter's CO, while Lt-Col Gisborne was Right Group's liaison officer at 137th (Staffordshire) Brigade, which was to make the division's right attack towards Gommecourt Wood. Right Group had its batteries dug in west and south west of Gommecourt with a concentration of three batteries around Chateau de la Haye and three others scattered around Sailly-au-Bois and Foncquevillers intermixed with 56th Division's batteries. C/CCXXXIII Battery at the end was lined up with Left Group's guns just west of Foncquevillers. Right Group's responsibility was the German line from the westernmost tip of Gommecourt Park to a point just north of the Gommecourt–Foncquevillers road.

46th Division used a high proportion of its 18-pounder ammunition to bombard enemy trenches and lines of communication, and a smaller proportion (about 27 per cent) of shrapnel shells to cut German barbed wire. However, on the right of the attack, the ground sloped away from the trajectory of the guns, making it difficult to judge Fuze-settings for wire-cutting. A/CCXXXIII and C/CCXXXIII batteries were assigned to wire-cutting on 137th Bde's front.

Apart from the wire-cutting batteries, the divisional artillery was under the direction of VII Corps during the preliminary bombardment, which began on 24 June, but at zero hour it reverted to divisional control. Once the infantry went 'over the top' the field guns were to make a series of short 'lifts', almost amounting to a 'creeping barrage'.

A final 'whirlwind' bombardment by all the guns began at 06.25 on 1 July and at zero hour (07.30) 137th Brigade made its attack with 1/6th Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment and 1/6th Bn North Staffordshire Regiment in the lead. Patrols had already established that the German wire was not adequately cut: there were four partially cut lanes on the South Staffs' front and five areas of weakened wire in front of the North Staffs. In addition, German casualties during the bombardment had been few because of their deep dugouts, and when the attack went in their men emerged to receive the attack with heavy machine-gun and rifle fire from their trenches and from Gommecourt Wood. Held up by uncut wire in dead ground and by enemy fire, the brigade's leading two waves only reached the German first line and were forced to take cover in shell holes where they exchanged Grenade attacks with the Germans. The third wave was stopped by machine gun fire short of the first line. The British infantry were unable to keep up with the covering barrage of the 18-pounders, which was lifted onto each enemy trench line to a strict timetable: artillery observation during the attack was difficult due to the smoke and confusion. Meanwhile, the supporting waves were held up in the jumping-off trenches or in No man's land by enemy shellfire. The whole attack had halted in bloody failure by 08.00.

Lieutenant-Colonel Gisborne and the commander of 137th Bde attempted to bring the barrage back so that a second attack could be launched by the supporting battalions (1/5th South Staffs and 1/5th North Staffs). At about 08.45 VII Corps ordered a renewed bombardment on Gommecourt Wood in which A and B/CCXXXIII Btys participated. But the support units were already inextricably held up by mud and shellfire in their own trenches and the attack was postponed several times. It was not until 15.30 that 137th Bde was ready to attack again. However, the neighbouring brigade never began the advance, and 137th Bde's officers called off the attack at the last minute.

The Gommecourt attack was a diversion, and it was not renewed after the first day's disaster. 46th Division remained in position while the Somme offensive continued further south throughout the summer and autumn. There was further reorganisation amongst divisional artillery, resulting in CCXXXIII Brigade being broken up on 29 August 1916 and distributed by sections so that the rest of the divisional artillery had 6-gun batteries. The two original Derbyshire Howitzer batteries, much reorganised, continued to serve as (D (H)/CCXXX Bty in 46th Divisional Artillery and D (H)/CCXXXII Bty in an Army Field Brigade) until the Armistice.

Meanwhile, the men who had not volunteered for foreign service, together with the recruits who were coming forward, remained at Derby to form the 2/IV North Midland Brigade (H). At first the 2nd Line recruits had to parade in civilian clothes and train with 'Quaker' guns – logs of wood mounted on cart wheels – but these shortages were slowly made up. Uniforms arrived in November 1914, but it was not until March 1915 that a few 90 mm French guns arrived for training. Later, some 5-inch howitzers were received, and the division took over the requisitioned transport and horse harness when 46th Division left for France. 2/IV North Midland Brigade formed part of 2nd North Midland Division (59th (2nd North Midland) Division from August 1915), which concentrated round its war station at Luton in January 1915, moving to St Albans in July. In early 1916 the batteries were finally brought up to establishment in horses, and 4.5-inch howitzers replaced the 5-inch howitzers.

In April 1916 the 59th Division was the mobile division of Central Force in England, and it was ordered to Ireland when the Easter Rising occurred, the divisional artillery landing at Kingstown on 28 April. The artillery moved up to Ballsbridge to support the infantry but was not engaged, and once the trouble in Dublin had been suppressed, the troops moved out to The Curragh to continue training. As was the case with the RFA units in the BEF, the brigade went through major reorganisation at this time. On 29 April 1916, the batteries were designated A (H) and B (H), and later the brigade was numbered CCXCVIII (298). At the end of May the brigade was joined by 3 (H) Bty from LIX Bde, a Kitchener's Army unit with 11th (Northern) Division, which became C (H) Bty. On 10 July, all three batteries were exchanged for 2/1st Hampshire Royal Horse Artillery (RHA), 2/1st Essex RHA, and 2/1st Glamorganshire RHA, which had recently joined the other three RFA brigades of 59th Division (CCXCV, CCXCVI and CCXCVII Bdes respectively). These RHA batteries were each equipped with four 18-pounder field guns rather than horse artillery guns, and the brigade lost its Howitzer designation. In July the BAC was merged into the 59th DAC.

In January 1917, the 59th Division was relieved in Ireland and returned to the UK, concentrating at the Fovant training area on the edge of Salisbury Plain preparatory to embarking for France. Before leaving Ireland, 2/1st Glamorgan RHA was split between the other two batteries to bring them up to six guns each. A new C (H) Bty was formed, but quickly broken up, to be replaced by D (H)/CCXCVII (the former 3 (H)/LIX). 59th Division began crossing to France on 17 February 1917 and concentrated around Méricourt. The last unit battery of CCXCVIII Bde arrived at Le Havre on 17 March, the day the Germans began their retreat to the Hindenburg Line (Operation Alberich). The brigade immediately took part in following this retreat in March and April.

On 4 April 1917, CCXCVIII Bde left 59th Division to become an Army Field Brigade. At the same time, C (H) Bty was transferred away to Fourth Army, to be replaced on 12 April by A/CCCXXXII Bty (originally 2/18th Lancashire Bty) from 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Division. Finally, D (H) Bty joined from Fourth Army Artillery on 1 August 1917 to complete the brigade to the organisation it kept for the remainder of the war:

The role of an Army Field Artillery (AFA) brigade was to reinforce sectors of the front as required, without breaking up divisional artilleries. After a period of rest, CCXCVIII Bde joined VIII Corps in a quiet area on 21 April before moving to 23rd Division in X Corps on 24 May as it was preparing for the Battle of Messines. The AFA brigades were moved into the area in secrecy, a battery at a time. Ammunition dumps had been formed containing 1000 rounds for each 18-pounder and 750 for each 4.5-inch howitzer, together with thousands of rounds of gas and smoke shells. The preparatory bombardment began on 26 May and the creeping barrage was practised on 3 and 5 June, inducing the Germans to reveal many of their own batteries, which were then bombarded. The guns ceased fire at 02.40 on 7 June and then the attack was launched at 03.10 with the firing of a series of massive mines under the Messines Ridge. The infantry advanced behind a creeping barrage (about two-thirds of the 18-pounders) protected by a standing barrage (the 4.5-inch howitzers and remaining 18-pounders) in front. Once the infantry reached their objectives, the creeping barrage became a protective barrage 150–300 yards ahead of them while they consolidated their positions. The plan worked to perfection, and there was scarcely any opposition to the initial attack from the stunned defenders. Some field batteries then moved forward into the old no-man's land to extend the protective barrage. This smashed the first German counter-attack launched at 14.00, and the British second phase attack was launched in the afternoon, taking its objectives.

The brigade continued supporting 23rd and 24th Divisions in X Corps until 4 July when Fifth Army's II Corps took over that sector of the front. It supported 24th Division during the early phases of the Third Ypres Offensive, which opened with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge on 31 July. Once again the field guns supplied the creeping barrage and standing barrage. Attacking towards 'Shrewsbury Forest', 24th Division got held up and left behind as the barrage advanced to timetable. The rest of the attack was a partial success, but II Corps' failure led to the development of a dangerous salient. Casualties among the gunners rose over the following days as they struggled amongst the mud to bombard the German line for a second attack (the Battle of Langemarck, 16–18 August).

24th Division and CCXCVIII AFA Bde reverted to X Corps in Second Army on 28 August, and the gunners were rested from 8 to 17 September. The brigade was assigned to XVIII Corps in Fifth Army for the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge (20–25 September) in which it supported 58th (2/1st London) Division. New artillery tactics involved five belts of fire, the first two fired by 18-pounders, the third by 4.5-inch howitzers, moving at a slow pace with frequent pauses to allow the infantry to keep up. Batteries also had the task of swinging off to engage targets of opportunity, and had spare detachments to avoid exhaustion of the gunners. The barrage was described as 'magnificent both in accuracy and volume', German counter attacks were broken up by shellfire, and the attack was a resounding success.

CCXCVIII AFA Brigade supported XVIII Corps' divisions through the following phases of the offensive, the battles of Polygon Wood (26 September–3 October), Broodseinde (4 October), Poelcappelle )9 October), 1st Passchendaele (12 October) and 2nd Passchendaele (26 October), where the conditions became increasingly impossible and the quality of artillery support diminished. The brigade was withdrawn for rest on 28 October before the fighting was over.

In November the brigade reverted to II Corps, and then moved in December to V Corps, where it supported 63rd (Royal Naval) Division from 21 December to 11 January 1918, including the action at Welch Ridge (30–31 December). It next joined III Corps, but was rested until 28 February when it was assigned to 14th (Light) Division. This formation was thinly spread along a stretch of line recently taken over from the French army, and quickly crumbled when it was attacked on the first day of the German Spring Offensive (21 March 1918). The divisional field artillery lost all their guns but the divisional artillery commander kept a composite force, including CCXCVIII AFA Bde and various heavy artillery batteries, in action until 29 March supporting 'Reynolds's Force' even after 14th Division had been withdrawn.

After the 'Great Retreat' of March 1918, CCXCVIII AFA Bde spent 31 March to 9 April 1918 refitting, before returning to the line with 58th Division in time for the fighting round Villers-Bretonneux. During this battle the brigade transferred to the neighbouring 5th Australian Division, and went with that formation to the Australian Corps. It remained with the Australians in Fourth Army throughout the summer of 1918, supporting different Australian divisions or acting as mobile Corps reserve during the Battle of Amiens (8 August) and the Second Battle of the Somme (21 August–2 September). The keynote of these attacks was thorough preparation and execution of the artillery fireplan, and then rapid movement of the field batteries behind the advancing infantry.

On 13 September 1918 the brigade transferred to IX Corps, which had been reconstituted in Fourth Army to take a leading role in the continuing Hundred Days Offensive. IX Corps assigned it to 1st Division for the Battle_of_Épehy (18 September), the attack on The Quadrilateral and Fresnoy (24 September), the Battle of St Quentin Canal (29 September–2 October) and the Battle of the Beaurevoir Line (3–5 October). It was rested for a while, then went back into the line supporting 1st and 32nd Divisions in the Battle of the Selle (16–20 October). After another short rest it caught up with 46th (North Midland) Division in time for the Battle of the Sambre (4–8 November), when the division advanced on 7 November to seize the Avesnes road. As 138th (Lincoln & Leicester) Bde advanced up the road, CCXXXI (2nd North Midland) and then CCXCVIII AFA Bdes put down concentrations of fire on the main points of resistance and the Germans began to withdraw.

Most of IX Corps, including CCXCVIII AFA Bde, halted for rest on 9 November having advanced more than 50 miles since it came into the line in September. It was still resting when the Armistice with Germany came into effect on 11 November.

When the TF was reformed in 1920 (and renamed as the Territorial Army (TA)), RFA brigades standardised on an establishment of three field and one howitzer battery: 3rd and 4th North Midland Bdes were combined into a single unit consisting of two Derbyshire batteries from the 4th and two Staffordshire batteries from the 3rd. Although the unit was briefly referred to as the 3rd North Midland Bde, its HQ was at Siddal's Road, Derby, and continued the lineage of the old 4th; it remained part of 46th (North Midland) Division. In 1921 it was redesignated as 62nd (North Midland) Brigade with the following organisation:

In 1924 the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA) and its brigades were redesignated 'Field Brigades'.

TA units each had a Regular Army adjutant; 62nd (NM) Fd Bde's adjutant during the early 1930s was Brevet Major William Revell-Smith, MC, who went on to become Major General, AA, in 21st Army Group during World War II.

During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA units and formations to the AA role. 46th (North Midland) Division became 2nd AA Division in 1936 and many of its infantry battalions were subsequently converted to AA gun or searchlight roles. By the end of 1937, 62nd Field Brigade was also being converted, and the following year Regimental HQ (RHQ) and the two Derby batteries reorganised as 68th (North Midland) AA Regiment (the RA adopted the designation 'regiment' instead of 'brigade' for a lieutenant-colonel's command in 1938) while the two Staffordshire batteries left to form the basis of 73rd AA Regiment at Wolverhampton. The new regiment had the following organisation:

68th (North Midland) AA Regiment

However, this organisation was short-lived: by May 1939 270 Bty had left to be part of a new 92nd AA Regiment forming at Pontefract and Rotherham, but this regiment was never completed and instead 270 AA Bty joined 81st AA Rgt. Meanwhile, 68th (NM) AA Rgt was completed by two new batteries, 276 and 277, raised in Nottingham.

The regiment formed part of 32nd (Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade based in Derby, which came under the command of 2nd AA Division.

The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations. 

At the time of mobilisation, 2 AA Division only had six heavy AA guns ready for action at Derby and another six at Nottingham, but by 11 July 1940, at the start of the Battle of Britain, this had risen to 40 at Derby and 16 at Nottingham. A new 50 Light AA Bde had taken over responsibility for these two Gun Defended Areas (GDAs) and 68th AA Rgt had been joined by detachments from 78th AA Rgt to man some of the guns.

At the same time, at the height of invasion fears after the Dunkirk evacuation, AA Brigades were required to form mobile columns available to combat enemy paratroopers. 50th LAA Bde's column called 'Macduff' consisted of one battery from 68th AA Rgt and one searchlight company to operate directly under 2 AA Division. In addition, Brigade HQ ordered all AA units to cooperate with field forces or the Local Defence Volunteers (LDVs, later called the Home Guard) by providing fighting patrols and guards when they could not perform their primary AA role. 68th AA Regiment was provided with 60 riflemen from training regiments to supplement its own spare men for these fighting patrols, who were instructed to 'meet guile with guile' to 'ruthlessly hunt down' highly trained German paratroopers. In the event there were no landings and the patrols were soon stood down.

In the summer of 1940, along with other AA units equipped with 3-inch, 3.7-inch or larger guns, the 68th was designated a Heavy AA (HAA) Regiment, to distinguish it from the new Light AA (LAA) units being formed.

The Midlands were barely affected during the Battle of Britain, though the Derby Barrage fired for the first time on 19 August 1940, and a series of night raids on Liverpool late in the month passed overhead.

68th HAA Regiment did not remain in its home area during the night-bombing Blitz that followed the "Luftwaffe" 's defeat in the Battle of Britain. It had been rostered for overseas service and left AA Command. As the war establishment for HAA regiments overseas was three batteries, 222 HAA Bty was detached and sent on as an independent battery to Malta, while the rest of the regiment went to Egypt soon afterwards. In December the newly-formed 113th HAA Rgt arrived to take over the Nottingham guns.

Malta had been under air attack since the day Italy entered the war (11 June 1940) and urgently needed AA reinforcements. As part of Operation Coat a convoy sailed from Liverpool on 30 October carrying two independent HAA batteries: 222 and 191 (which had similarly been detached from 69th (Warwickshire) HAA Rgt), one LAA battery (59 from 19th LAA Rgt), and spare AA guns and gun barrels. At Gibraltar, the convoy collected RHQ of 10th HAA Rgt, which had been formed in that garrison in December 1939. The convoy sailed on from Gibraltar on 7 November and the troops disembarked in Malta on 10 November where they joined the garrison. 10th HAA Regiment took over command of 199 and 222 HAA Btys. The rest of 69th HAA Rgt mobilised for overseas service in November, but the order was rescinded, and only 190 HAA Bty sailed, reaching Malta in January and joining 10th HAA Rgt.
By January 1941, the"Luftwaffe" had joined the "Regia Aeronautica" in attacks on Malta. On 11 January the damaged aircraft carrier HMS "Illustrious" came into Grand Harbour for repairs. The "Luftwaffe" laid on a major air raid (possibly 50 Junkers Ju 88 and 20 Junkers Ju 87 "Stuka" 's) on 16 January to finish off the carrier, but the AA guns on the island had been re-sited to defend the ship alongside Parlotorio Wharf with a 'box' barrage, and the raiders suffered heavily. A second raid made two days later was also disrupted by the defences. Only one bomb hit the ship, but the adjacent towns were badly hit, and nearby ships and AA positions suffered casualties. On 19 January the "Luftwaffe" tried again, with a diversionary raid on Luqa airfield, but "Illustrious" made her way to Alexandria under her own steam on 23 January.
In February the "Luftwaffe" 's "Fliegerkorps X" was ordered to neutralise Malta, and it began a series of heavy bombing raids, mainly at night, accompanied by mine-dropping in and around the harbour, and daylight sweeps by Messerschmitt Bf 109 single-engined fighters. In March there was dive-bombing against the RAF airfields, and attacks on a supply convoy on 23 March. The HAA guns were engaged almost every day, taking a steady toll of the bombers. By the beginning of June the depleted "Fliegerkorps X" handed responsibility back to the Italians.
From April 1941, the regiment, together with 7th HAA Rgt and the Royal Malta Artillery HAA, came under 7 AA Brigade covering the south half of the island, while 10 AA Brigade took the north. This arrangement was found not to work, and soon 7 AA Bde took over all the LAA and S/L defences, and 10th AA Bde commanded the HAA guns, including 10th HAA Rgt, which defended the RAF airfields. New guns and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar also arrived on the island.
Malta was largely left alone during the summer of 1941, but attacks resumed in November 1941 after "Fliegerkorps II" arrived in Sicily. Air raids were increasingly common during November and December, and rations and supplies began to run short. At the turn of the year 10 HAA Bde instituted a policy of rotating its units to maintain freshness. 10th HAA Rgt exchanged with 7th HAA Rgt and took responsibility for defending Fort Manoel and Grand Harbour. At this point it manned 4 x 4.5-inch guns, 16 x 3.7-inch and 4 x 3-inch guns.

The "Luftwaffe" continued to pound the island, concentrating on the harbour and airfields, usually with raids of 15 Ju 88s escorted by 50 or more fighters. By now the RAF fighter strength had been reduced to a handful of aircraft, and the AA guns were the main defence. March and April 1942 were the period of the heaviest air raids on Malta, with well over 250 sorties a day on occasions. In April 1942 the "Luftwaffe" switched tactics to "Flak" suppression, with particular attention being paid to the HAA gunsites. On the last day of April the "Regia Aeronautica" rejoined the attack – which the AA gunners took as a sign that the "Luftwaffe" was suffering badly. By now each HAA regiment on Malta was rationed to 300 rounds per day and replacement gun barrels were scarce. When the fast minelayer HMS "Welshman" ran in ammunition supplies on 10 May (part of Operation Bowery), the most intense AA barrage yet fired was provided to protect her while unloading. After that, Axis air raids tailed off during the summer, apart from a flare-up in July.

By October the "Luftwaffe" had reinforced "Fliegerkorps II", and a new round of heavy raids began, using new low-level tactics. However, these attacks also lost heavily to the AA guns and RAF fighters, despite the increasing shortages of food and supplies on the island. At last, in November "Welshman" and her sister ship HMS "Manxman" appeared, followed by a supply convoy. With the Axis defeat at Alamein and the Allied North Africa landings the same month, the siege of Malta was ended. The only enemy air activity for the rest of the year was occasional high-flying reconnaissances and one raid on Luqa in December.

The rest of 68th (NM) HAA Rgt disembarked at Port Said in Egypt on 22 April 1941 with 200, 276 and 277 HAA Btys, under the command of Lt-Col F. Horlingham. It joined 2 AA Bde defending the Suez Canal and the harbours of Port Said and Port Suez at either end, which were vital to the flow of supplies and reinforcements to the army in the Western Desert. By October 1941, the Suez Canal defences had absorbed 72 HAA guns, while another 40 (including the eight 3.7-inch guns of 277 HAA Bty) were defending the port of Alexandria.

At the end of 1941 the regiment joined Eighth Army for its new offensive in the Western Desert (Operation Crusader), which began in November and succeeded in ending the Siege of Tobruk. 68th HAA Regiment was moved up to defend the captured port of Benghazi. The first phase of 'Crusader' lasted until January 1942, when General Erwin Rommel counter-attacked. Benghazi was lost again on 29 January and Eighth Army fell back and dug in along the Gazala Line.

There was then a lull in the fighting until May, while both sides reorganised. By 12 May 1942, RHQ 68 HAA Rgt and 277 HAA Bty were defending the port of Tobruk under 4 AA Bde, 276 HAA Bty was with 12 AA Bde defending fighter landing grounds for the Desert Air Force, and 200 HAA Bty was at the army's railhead at Fort Capuzzo. On 22 May the regiment was joined in Tobruk by 107 LAA Bty from 27th LAA Rgt, which formed the sole LAA defence of the harbour. 

The Battle of Gazala began on 26 May, and Rommel's Axis forces quickly broke into the British position and began attacking the defensive 'boxes'. After bitter fighting in the Gazala Line and the 'Cauldron', Eighth Army was forced to retreat. The British hoped to defend Tobruk as in the previous siege, but the Axis forces reached it before the defences were ready.

The attack on Tobruk began on 20 June. After the preliminary air bombardment, Axis tanks made rapid progress through the perimeter defences. The 3.7-inch HAA guns had been deeply dug in for protection against dive-bombing, but a four-gun troop of 277 HAA Bty found themselves faced with action at short notice against Panzer III and Panzer IV tanks of 21st Panzer Division driving down the escarpment from 'King's Cross' towards the harbour. The gunners stripped down the walls of their emplacements to permit low-angle fire and engaged the tanks with armour-piercing and high explosive rounds. Together with some South African field guns and medium guns the position held up a Panzer battalion for four hours and knocked out four tanks, but the outcome was inevitable and the AA positions were 'overrun by swarms of enemy infantry'. Rommel himself referred to the 'extraordinary tenacity' of the strongpoint.

Tobruk surrendered the following day, and around 33,000 Allied troops were captured. 68th HAA Regiment lost its HQ, 277 HAA Bty, and its attached detachments of the Royal Corps of Signals, the Royal Army Service Corps, and workshop section of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps.

After the fall of Tobruk, the Eighth Army retreated in confusion beyond Fort Capuzzo and the Egyptian frontier, with artillery of all sorts involved in rearguard actions. The Axis advance was finally halted at El Alamein. It is not clear how much of 68th HAA Rgt's detached batteries survived the retreat. In September 1942 the remnants of the regiment were officially reduced to a cadre.

After the Tobruk disaster, 222 HAA Bty stationed on Malta as part of 10th HAA Rgt was deemed 'to carry on the honour title, traditions and plate' of 68th (NM) HAA Rgt. On 1 June 1943, RHQ 10th HAA Rgt was officially disbanded and reformed as RHQ 68th (NM) HAA Rgt, with the same batteries: 222 from Derby, 190 and 191 from Birmingham.

At the time the regiment was manning 15 x 3.7-inch and 6 x 4.5-inch guns and formed part of a large AA concentration protecting the build-up of forces in Malta for the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky):

Although the AA defences of Malta were progressively run down as units returned home or joined the campaigns in Sicily and later in mainland Italy, 68th HAA Rgt remained part of the permanent garrison of the island until the end of the war and beyond. The regiment was placed in suspended animation in Malta in December 1946 so that it could be officially reformed in the TA in the UK on 1 January 1947. (The personnel remaining in Malta became 36 HAA Rgt in the Regular RA.)

The regiment was reconstituted at Derby (with many of its Malta veterans returning) as 262 (North Midland) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, forming part of 58 AA Bde (the former 32 (Midland) AA Bde). The term '(Mixed)' was added to the designation on 1 July 1951, indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit.

On 1 January 1954, without changing its title, the regiment absorbed 526 LAA Rgt, another unit based in Derby.

This lasted until the disbandment of AA Command in March 1955 when there were wholesale mergers among TA units. 262 (NM) HAA Regiment was amalgamated with 579 (Royal Leicestershire Regiment) LAA Rgt and 585 (Northamptonshire Regiment) LAA/Searchlight Rgt to form 438 LAA Rgt. The new unit was organised as follows:

The new regiment was relatively shortlived, being broken up on 1 May 1961, when the Royal Leicestershire and Northamptonshire batteries rejoined their parent infantry regiments. P Battery was converted to the Royal Engineers, becoming 438 (Derbyshire Artillery) Field Squadron in a newly formed 140 Corps Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers based in Nottingham.

140 Corps Engineer Rgt was disbanded in 1967 when the TA was reduced to the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve, but elements contributed to the formation of the Derbyshire Battalion of the Sherwood Foresters.

While stationed on Malta, 222 HAA Bty adopted an embroidered arm badge consisting of a white Maltese cross on a shield divided vertically in the Royal Artillery colours of red (left) and blue (right). This badge was subsequently adopted after the war by 262 HAA Rgt and continued in use with P Bty of 438 LAA Rgt.

The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit:

There are two memorials to the 46th (North Midland) Division on the battlefield of the Hohenzollern Redoubt: one on the road between between Vermelles and Hulluch, marking the jumping-off point of the attack, and one on the site of the redoubt itself, which lists all the units of the division.

In 1927, bronze memorial plaques to the men of the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division who died in World War I were erected in the parish churches of the towns and cities most closely connected with the division, including All Saints' Church, Derby (which became Derby Cathedral that year), and Chesterfield Parish Church in Derbyshire. These tablets list all the units of the division.

<doc id="57283903" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57283903" title="Rizaeddin bin Fakhreddin">
Rizaeddin bin Fakhreddin

Rizaeddin bin Fakhreddin (* 12. Januar 1858 in Kichuchat, Samara; † 1936) was a Tatar Scholar that lived in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. His numerous works on religious, political and pedagogical subjects were a part of the Jadidist movement, and the newspaper Shura, which he created and published, was an important way of political discussion for Muslims in the late Empire.

Rizaeddin bin Fakhreddin was born as son of a Mullah in the village of Kichuchat in the gouvernement Samara. He studied at the Maktab in his village, which his father led, and then at the Madrasa in the near village of Chelsheli. At the age of 30, he became Mullah and leader of the Madrasa in the village of Ilbek. In 1891, he was elected Qadi, meaning he became a member of the Russian religious administration for Muslims ("Sobranie"); he therefore moved to its seat in Ufa. There, he administrated the extensive archive of the agency. During the 1905 Russian Revolution, he submitted an extensive reform program to the Muftis of the "Sobranie". This program, among other things, included the extension of the responsibility of the agency over the Khazak Muslims. The Russian government refused the program due to the expected gain in power this centralization would have brought for the Muslims.

In 1906, Fakhreddin retired from his religious office and became editor of the Orenburg Newspaper "Vaqt". Two years later, he started publishing his newspaper Shura, which became the longest-lived of the Tatar newspapers in the Russian Empire. After the Revolution of 1917, in 1921, he again took on a religious office and was Mufti of the European regions of Russia until his death in 1936. He avoided cooperating with the Soviets as much as possible.

As it was a part of Jadidism, Fakhreddins work was influenced by many other Djadids. For example, he studied at the Madrasa of Shahabeddin Marjani for some time and later met the political activist Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī during a journey in St. Petersburg. The Egyptian scholar Muhammad Abduh was another influence.

Fakhreddin spoke Arabic, Persian, Turkic and Russian. He used Turki, which had been proclaimed by Ismail Gaspirali as common language for all Turkic people, but kept Tatar linguistic pecularities.

Fakhreddin was an extremely productive author, who wrote more than sixty books during his life. His most important work is a two-volume edition of biographies of Central Asian Scholars ("Asar" and "Meshhur Irler"), which he wrote while he was at the archive of the Muslim religious administration. On some of the depicted individuals (which include Ibn Rushd (Averroes), Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali and Ibn Taymiyyah) his work still remains the best source.
He also published journalistic texts, books and essays on the general situation of Muslims in Russia, pedagogical works or on social debates (for example on women's education and family politics). His essay "Rusya Muslimanlarining ihtiyachlari ve anlar haqinda intiqad", published in 1906, is a critique against the reform demands of the Ulama against the Russian rulers, which Fakhreddin regarded as too vague.

According to Azade-Ayşe Rorlich, the importance of education for the overcoming of poverty and the possibility of a reconciliation of Islam and science were central parts of Fakhreddins world view. He saw the rise and fall of nations as directly connected to their belief systems and therefore believed that a renunciation of superstition and a return to the beginnings of Islam would be necessary for a Muslim renaissance. He also criticized the historical work of Ibn Khallikan due to his concentration on the doings of rulers and tried to honor the deeds of "normal" Muslims in his books and writings.

Georges Lesueur

Joseph Georges Lesueur (15 April 1834 – 13 January 1910) was a French railway engineer, public works contractor and politician who was Senator of Algeria from 1888 to 1897.

Georges Lesueur was born on 15 April 1834 in Bordeaux, Gironde.
He attended the École Polytechnique, and was engineer for various railway companies including the networks of the East of France, the North of Spain, the Trans-Siberian and the Trans-Saharan.
Around 1860 he married Marie Martin.
Their children were Andrée, Roger and Germaine Lesueur.

As a public works contractor Lesueur directed construction of the port of Philippeville, which had been considered impossible, the port of Bône, the Bougie ferry terminal, bridges over the Soummam and Seybouse rivers, and the port of Bizerte.
During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he formed his workers into armed companies to replace the regular troops who had been sent to metropolitan France.
Although the government told him to suspend all public works, he continued them using his own money to avoid laying off workers.
Lesueur became President of the Superior Council of the Constantine department, and Vice-President of the Superior Council of Algeria.
He was a Knight of the Legion of Honour.

Lesueur was elected to the Senate on 5 January 1888 in the first round by 94 votes against 89 for the incumbent senator Dominique Forcioli.
On 10 March 1888 there was a lengthy debate in the Senate on his election.
Alfred Joseph Naquet disputed the validity of the ballot and pointed out irregularities such as visits by the Prefect of Constantine with Lesueur to several communes in the department and subsidies given to some communes on the eve of the election.
However, the Senate ruled by 146 votes to 110 that the election was valid.

In the Senate Lesueur sat on the left and belong to the Republican Union group.
He was a member of a number of committees, and was particularly concerned with defending Algerian interests.
He abstained from voting on the military law.
He voted for reestablishment of the district poll (13 February 1889), for the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and for the process to be followed in the Senate against General Boulanger.
Lesueur was member of the Customs Committee; the Railway Committee, of which he became Secretary in 1894, and the Finance Committee.
He was rapporteur for many motions related to freign trade, railways and shipping.
He was Secretary of the committee for improvements to the port of Saint-Nazaire, and secretary of the senatorial group of maritime interests.

In 1893 Lesueur asked the government to reserve some types of industrial and agricultural activity to Algeria to reduce unemployment,
He wanted to make Algeria the granary of France, and to make the Filfla marble quarries the rivals of Carrara.
He served as Administrator Delegate to the Paris Stock Exchange and President of the jury of the Antwerp exhibition.
The Société africaine de France (French African Society) was founded in 1888 as a learned society, but soon ran into difficulties.
It was restored under the chairmanship of Lesueur in 1895 as a vehicle for propaganda of the colonial party, linked to groups such as the Syndicat français du bassin du Tchad (French Syndicate of the Chad Basin).

Lesueur did not run for reelection in 1897.
He died in Paris on 13 January 1910 at the age of 75.

Russell Maurice Johnson (born 1947) is a Canadian serial killer who was convicted of raping and murdering at least three women in the 1970s, although the total number of victims later turned out to be higher. He is known as the Bedroom Strangler.

Johnson stalked his victims to their homes and waited there until they slept before he attacked. He sometimes watched the women sleep before sexually assaulting and suffocating them.

Johnson was indicted after he was arrested for the murders of Diane Beitz, Louella George and Donna Veldboom, but was declared insane in 1978. Since then he has been locked up in a secure department of a psychiatric institution in Ontario. After his confinement, Johnson confessed to committing seven murders and ten more cases in which he non-fatally attacked women in a period of 18 years.

Many of his killings were not initially noted as murders, due to the lack of traces of violence. For example, the cause of death of Mary Hicks and Eleanor Hartwick was initially attributed to a negative reaction to medicine. Suffocation was noticed on the bodies of Beitz and George, in their cases being strangulation.

Johnson's murdered victims were:

On 15 June Melentyeva went with fellow partisan Anna Lisitsyna and six other Komsomol members to Sheltozersky district, which was controlled by the Axis in order to conduct a reconnaissance-in-force mission and establish an underground Komsomol organization. When the plane that was supposed to bring the partisans back to friendly territory could not come the eight were told they would have to walk on foot across enemy lines to hand over documents containing the information they had gathered on the locations of Axis garrisons and names of individuals that were fighting for the Axis. During the crossing of the icy Svir River on 3 August 1942 her friend Anna Lisitsyna drowned, but Melentyeva managed to recover the documents Lisitsyna was carrying in her hat. Alone, Melentyeva wandered through the forest for five days without clothes, shoes, or food, carrying only the bundle of documents with her. On the sixth day she encountered the 272nd Infantry Regiment of the Red Army and was able to hand over the documents.

In the summer of 1943 she was sent on another mission inside Axis-controlled territory; she was supposed to make contact with underground Komsomol committee she had helped establish in Sheltozersky and report back any information they had. After an informant had reported their activities to the Finnish military a standoff ensued, with Melentyeva firing on surrounding Finnish forces until she and the other surviving partisans were captured and taken prisoner. After refusing to answer the Finnish military's questions the partisans were shot at point-blank range inside a cellar on 2 July 1943. They were later buried in Topornaya Gora, Medvezhyegorsky District. 

Melentyeva was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 25 September 1943 by decree of the Supreme Soviet, the same day as Anna Lisitsyna. She was also a recipient of the Order of the Red Star. Her image is featured in the Petrozavodsk Gallery of Heroes, a street in Karelia was named in her honor, and there are several monuments and memorials to her throughout Karelia.

Al-Faqir Fort

al-Faqir Fort (Arabic: قلعة الفقير) is an 18th-century fort situated in the Levantine pilgrimage route on a small hilltop in the southern portion of modern-day al-Ula, Saudi Arabia. The fort takes a squared form with round towers, three of which are standing while the southern one was completely destroyed. The fort occupies 340 m with approximate height of slightly over 6 m tall walls, that appears to be originally two-storey structure supported by wooden beams.

Most of the interior walls, ceilings, and stairs of the fort were destroyed. Nothing left except for the walls and towers along with small interior remains.

The fort was originally known in historical documents as the fort of al-Hafa'ir. It was built by the Ottoman dynasty to facilitate the pilgrims and to protect them in their journey to the holy sites.

Varieties of materials were used during the construction, primarily local limestones and sandstones (also schist and gneiss) additional to the employment of bricks on the upper levels and in different parts of the structure.

The Jack County Courthouse, at 100 N. Main St. in Jacksboro, Texas, was completed in 1940. It was designed in 1939 by Wichita Falls architects Voelker & Dixon. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.

It is a three-story building with basement, and has "remarkable" integrity according to its 2012 NRHP nomination, which states its "cast-in-place concrete structure is sheathed in Texas limestone with marble spandrels. The building is modernistic in its block massing and stylized details, and stands as a rich example of the Modem Classical Style, a contemporary interpretation of classical design, with fluted pilasters separating recessed vertically ranked window and spandrel bays, and an entablature with low relief sculpture. The rich interior spaces and finishes are largely intact, including the original decorative light fixtures, stone and wood paneled wall veneers, decorative moldings, door hardware, duct covers, and aluminum cashier window screens. The courthouse exterior and interior retain a very high degree of architectural integrity."

The courthouse is the fourth courthouse building to have served the county. It replaced an 1885 courthouse. The first courthouse was established in 1858 in an already-existing wooden building on the west side of the Jacksboro town square, which was remodeled at cost of $800.

Russian occupations of Beirut

The Russian occupations of Beirut were two separate military expeditions by the Mediterranean fleet of the Imperial Russian Navy, as part of its Levant campaign during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774. The main objective of this campaign was to assist local forces led by Zahir al-Umar and Ali Bey al-Kabir, who were in open rebellion against the Ottoman Empire.

The first occupation began in June 1772, when Russian troops landed in Beirut, following five consecutive days of naval bombardment. The squadron left the port town after a few days. The second occupation of Beirut began in October 1773, this time by request of the Druze chieftain Yusuf Shihab. After two months of heavy bombardment, Beirut's newly appointed defender, Jazzar Pasha, offered to surrender himself to Zahir's forces. The occupying force, which consisted of a few hundred Albanian mercenaries, remained in the town till February 1774.

Despite the brevity of Russia's campaign in the Arab Levant and the failure of both Ali and Zahir's revolts, the occupation of Beirut marked the first time in over 250 years in which the town was ruled by a foreign non-Ottoman power. It also marked the first and only occasion in which Russian rule was imposed over an Arab city.

With the gradual advance of European powers, namely Austria and Russia, upon the northern Ottoman frontiers since the beginning of the 18th century, insubordination among local governors in the largely decentralized Arab provinces of Ottoman Syria became more apparent. Shortly after the Ottoman Porte's declaration of war on Russia in 1768, Sultan Mustafa III demanded military assistance from Ali Bey, a Mamluk who was the most powerful official in Ottoman Egypt at the time. But instead of providing soldiers to the Porte, Ali Bey declared Egypt's independence, chiefly in response to the war with Russia, and later struck an alliance with Zahir al-Umar, a wealthy Arab ruler in northern Palestine.

Meanwhile, in the spring of 1769, Tsarina Catherine the Great, lacking an organized Russian fleet in the Black Sea, drew plans with Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov to detach a large number of ships from the Baltic Fleet and deploy them to the Mediterranean. Russia hoped it would attack the Turkish Straits from the rear, and that its naval presence in the Aegean would provoke a Greek rebellion.. This newly formed Mediterranean Fleet, headed by Orlov and commanded by Admiral Grigory Spiridov, took off from Copenhagen on September 23. By March 1, 1770, the first detachment was anchored at the southern Morea, which was followed by bombardments and troop landings at different locations in the region throughout the coming months. On July 7, a Turkish fleet was crushed at the Battle of Chesma, which severely crippled the Ottoman Navy and gave the Russians command of the sea over the Mediterranean throughout the remainder of the war. Turkish ships that survived retreated to the Dardanelles. Rear-Admiral John Elphinstone proposed a direct assault on Constantinople, but was instead convinced by Orlov to blockade the Straits with his squadron, while the rest of the fleet went on the offensive in the northern Aegean.

In late 1770, Ali Bey dispatched an army of 40,000 troops, commanded by his trusted general Muhammad Bey Abu al-Dhahab, which joined forces with Zahir's army in the spring of 1771 and went on to occupy several towns in the Levant. However, soon after the fall of Damascus in early June, Ottoman agents managed to convince Muhammad Bey to turn against Ali Bey and that he would be made ruler of Egypt in his stead. Muhammad Bey retreated with his army, and got eventually caught in a power struggle against his former master over control of Egypt. Zahir, on his part, became isolated in his sheikhdom and had to face an inevitable Ottoman counteroffensive on his own. Ali Bey was then convinced that he could easily reverse his recent setbacks through an alliance with Russia. On December 2, 1772, he sent an Armenian envoy to meet with Orlov at the Mediterranean Fleet's headquarters in the Aegean island of Paros where he would offer the Russians an alliance treaty.

However, while the offer was later accepted by the Tsarina, both her knowledge of the proposed alliance and Ali Bey's knowledge of the favorable outcome came after the latter was no longer ruling Egypt, as he was eventually forced to leave the country for his ally Zahir when the standoff between him and Muhammad Bey finally escalated to armed confrontations.

By the time it appeared off Beirut on July 6, Commander Kozhuchov's squadron consisted of the following ships:

Alexander Schwab

Alexander Schwab (5 July 1887 - 12 November 1943) was a German political activist. He withdrew from active participation in politics after resigning from the fractious and short-lived Communist Workers' Party (""Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands"" / KAPD) in 1922, but continued his contribution as an independent left of centre commentator-journalist. During the twelve Nazi years he was arrested several times, spending the final years of his life, between 1936 and 1943, in a succession of jails. Sources may also identify him by the pseudonym under which some of his contributions were published, as Albert Sigrist Sachs.

Alexander Schwab was born into a Protestant family in Stuttgart. He grew up in Danzig where his father Karl Julius Schwab, a musician and composer, was in charge of the music (""als Opernkappelmeister"") at the city opera house. He attended a Gymnasium (secondary school) in Danzig and then moved on to study Philosophy, Germanistics, Classical languages, , Sociology and at Rostock, Jena, Heidelberg and Freiburg i.B.. At university he participated actively in the , a grouping of students who were expressly not members of the more traditional student fraternities. He was also a member of the politically left-of-centre Wandervogel hiking movement. Alexander Schwab received his doctorate from Heidelberg University in 1913. His doctoral dissertation was entitled "The influence of consumption on the German furniture industry and production" (""Der Einfluß der Konsumtion auf Möbelindustrie und Möbelproduktion in Deutschland""), but when it was published two years later it was under the shorter title "Möbelkonsumtion und Möbelproduktion in Deutschland".

For a year following the award of his doctorate, during 1913/14, Schwab taught at the , a progressive school that had been founded by the controversial education pioneer Gustav Wyneken in the countryside south of Erfurt in 1906. Several historians describe Schwab during this period as one of the leading intellects of the influential Free German Youth movement. In October 1913 he participated in the first ever in the Hoher Meißner hills north of Frankfurt. In the months before the war he also involved himself in conceptualising and organising democratically elected "General Student Committees" (""Allgemeiner Studenten-Ausschüsse"").

Around this time Schwab and some of his intellectual friends rented a large house in Jena and embarked on what was seen at the time as a remarkable experiment in cohabitation, whereby four unmarried young men and four unmarried young women all lived together in the one house. On 8 May 1914 the unmarried status of two members of the cohabiting community ended when Alexander Schwab married Dr Hildegard Felisch: it was her twenty-fifth birthday.

At the end of July 1914 war broke out. Alexander Schwab lost little time in volunteering for the army. He was very quickly rejected for military service, however, on account of a pulmonary hemorrhage (""Lungen-Blutsturz""). He was instead sent to a desk job in the war supplies department. Later he found himself working in Dresden at the .

Despite having volunteered for military service in 1914, by 1918 Alexander Schwab had joined the anti-war movement. He became friendly with the radical socialist educationalist Otto Rühle (1874–1943) and with the young artist Conrad Felixmüller. In 1917 Schwab joined the Independent Social Democratic Party (""Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"" / USPD) which had broken away from the mainstream Social Democratic Party (""Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands"" / SPD) following an intensification of internal party ructions over funding for the war. The next year he joined the Spartacus League: he was numbered among the close friends of the movement's best-known founders, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.

At the end of the year the USPD gave way to the Communist Party of Germany, founded formally at a three day conference in Berlin between 30 December 1918 and 1 January 1919. Schwab found himself on the left wing of the Communist Party, collaborating closely with with Karl Schröder (1884–1950). Beyond the world of party politics, directly following the revolutions of 1918/19, he teamed up with the teacher Frieda Winckelmann (1873–1943) and others to set up a "Free academy community for proletarians" (""Freie Hochschulgemeinde für Proletarier"") from which emerged, in the first part of 1919, the "Soviet school of the Greater Berlin labour movement" (""Räteschule der Groß-Berliner Arbeiterschaft""). Barely two years later the institution became insolvent and was taken over by the trades unions. 

The parties of the left were prone to fragment during this period, and in 1920 Alexander Schwab and his friend Karl Schröder were founder members of the Communist Workers' Party (""Kommunistische Arbeiter-Partei Deutschlands"" / KAPD), becoming a leading ideological strategist of its Berlin group. In June/july 1921 he led the KAPD delegation to the third world congress of the Communist International (Comintern), held in Moscow. He was sharply critical of Comrade Lenin's political tactics in respect of western Europe: the speeches he contributed were published in the congress minutes, using the cover name "Sachs" to identify him.

Beyond Fear is a British television crime dramatisation, first broadcast on March 30, 1997, the opening night of Channel 5, that details the kidnap of estate agent Stephanie Slater by convicted murderer Michael Sams. The drama was adapted from Slater's acclaimed book of the same name by screenwriter Don Shaw, with Jenny Wilkes assigned to direct. "Beyond Fear" starred Gina McKee as Slater and Sylvester McCoy as Sams, with Judith Anthony, Kitty McGeever, Sally Rogers and Iain Rogerson also appearing in key roles.

Gerard Gilbert of "The Independent" gave praise to "Beyond Fear", writing: "The undoubted jewel in Channel 5's rather wobbly opening-night crown. This is a fine, unsalacious reconstruction of Slater's brave cat-and-mouse encounter with her captor, and Gina McKee gives a convincing portrayal of a normal young woman in an intolerable situation. Former "Doctor Who" alumni Sylvester McCoy is gruffly menacing as Sams." 1.7 million viewers tuned it for the drama's debut broadcast. Notably, "Beyond Fear" has never been released on VHS or DVD, although has previously been repeated on True Entertainment as part of their "Best of British" season.

James Houghton (artistic director)

James Houghton (September 4, 1958 - August 2, 2017) is an American educator, mentor, and arts administrator. He is primarily known for being the former Director of Drama at The Juilliard School and the former artistic director of Signature Theatre Company.

James Houghton was born in San Francisco, California to mother Joan Heaney, a preschool teacher and dental assistant, and father Sherrill Houghton, a school administrator. He first found his love of theatre at St. Ignatius Preparatory School, a Jesuit school in the Bay Area. There, he started his own theatre company with friends called Overeasy Productions at age 18.

Then, Houghton attended Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas as young actor, and directly after college auditioned for John Houseman and gained a spot in his prestigious group, The Acting Company.

Houghton was married to actress Joyce O'Connor with whom he had two children, Henry and Lily.

While in New York City early in his career, Houghton was working as an actor, director, waiter and carpenter.

Houghton became the artistic director of the Eugene O'Neill Theatre Center in Waterford, Connecticut from 2000-2003. Here, he developed plays by Kia Corthron, Gina Gionfriddo, David Lindsay-Abaire, and Adam Rapp among others.

When he was working with Romulus Linney, he first got the idea for Signature Theatre Company to showcase one playwright for an entire season. Featuring Linney, the first season starting in 1991 had 6 shows in a 87 seat house and spent $35,000. In the 1994-1995 season, they featured playwright Horton Foote and produced "The Young Man From Atlanta", which later was produced on Broadway and won a Pulitzer Prize. Signature would go on to feature playwrights such as Edward Albee, Arthur Miller, Adrienne Kennedy, Maria Irene Fornes, and more recently the likes of Athol Fugard and Annie Baker.

It became apparent to Houghton soon that Signature Theatre Company needed a permanent and flexible home, and needed to build a theater, so in 2009 Houghton began fundraising. The building was first going to be featured at the Ground Zero location downtown as part of a redevelopment of downtown by mayjor Michael Bloomberg. When costs began to be prohibitive, they moved towards the 42nd street Times Square theatre district. Part of the program to convince to build there was a plan to underwrite tickets so that they would be frozen at $25 each.

Houghton ended up raising $70 million for the project. Pershing Square Signature Center opened in 2012, and is a three-theatre, 75,000 square foot complex designed by Frank Gehry Architects. It also includes two studio spaces, a shared lobby with a café, a bookshop, concerige desk, and administrative offices. The intent was to create a haven for theatre-makers, especially playwrights, that would hold 10 playwrights in residence to produce shows from the level of readings to full productions and all levels in-between. The goal of these types of programs and the subsequent building where to provide a sense of living and creating under one roof and creating points of intersection between artists, as Houghton once explained:

Houghton stepped down for the 2015-2016 season, and was replaced by Paige Evans, formerly the artistic director of LCT3, the new-play development program at Lincoln Center Theater.

Houghton became the Richard Rodgers Director of Drama at The Juilliard School in the 2006-2007 season, taking over the program that was founded by his former mentor John Houseman.

After starting at Juilliard, he shifted the program from a one day audition process and a cut program that would drop up to 1/3 of students after their first year to a weekend audition process with no-cuts. He also obtained funding and created for a Master of Fine Arts program that fully funds the students' final year of school as well as provides a stipend for living and working. Additionally, the masters program included a partnership with Signature in order to give students experience in a professional theatrical atmosphere. He spoke on his goals for the program: "My greatest hope for the students graduating from the Juilliard graduate division is that we provide them the opportunity to be expressive and more of themselves, and that we give them the tools to express through their work in a manner that is generous, responsible and authentic. We want our graduates to enter the workplace not just prepared for the task at hand, but equipped to produce work that ultimately stems from their core selves… who they are, and their own voice." 

In 2015, Houghton was presented a special Obie Award by the American Theatre Wing for Sustained Achievement in the theatrical community.

On August 2, 2017, Houghton died of stomach cancer.

Former collaborator Tony Kushner wrote on the death of Houghton: "He was smart and passionate. He built his singular legacy, founded on his devotion to playwrights’ work and to playwrights themselves, with a uniquely sweet, generous spirit; with unflagging optimism; and with grace."

Colleague Oskar Eustis, artistic director of The Public Theatre, wrote upon hearing of Houghton's passing: "By his example, he reminded me constantly that we are all in this together, that theater isn’t a competition but a communion, that art isn’t a zero-sum game but a way of being that elevates all of us, and that the collaborative nature of our form must be reflected in the way we treat one another."

Rafał Milach

Rafał Milach (born 1978) is a Polish visual artist and photographer. His work is about the transformation taking place in the former Eastern Bloc, for which he undertakes long-term projects.

Milach's books include "7 Rooms" (2011), "In the Car with R" (2012), "Black Sea of Concrete" (2013), "The Winners" (2014) and "The First March of Gentlemen" (2017). He is a co-founder of the Sputnik Photos collective.

He won a 2008 World Press Photo award. "7 Rooms" won the Pictures of the Year International Best Photography Book Award in 2011. In 2017 his exhibition "Refusal" was a finalist for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize.

Milach lectures in photography at the Institute of Creative Photography (ITF), Silesian University in Opava, Czech Republic.

Milach was born in 1978 ­in Gliwice, Poland. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Katowice in 2003 and the Institute of Creative Photography (ITF), Silesian University in Opava, Czech Republic.

With ten other Central Eastern European photographers, he co-founded Sputnik Photos, a collective documenting transition in post-Soviet states.

For his first book, "7 Rooms" (2011), Milach accompanied and photographed seven young people for several years living in the Russian cities of Moscow, Yekaterinburg and Krasnoyarsk.

"In the Car with R" (2012) was made on a 10 day road trip, driving 1450 kilometres around Iceland's circular Route 1. Milach made photographs and his local guide, the writer , made diary entries.

"Black Sea of Concrete" (2013) is about the Ukrainian Black Sea coast, about its people, of whom he made portraits, and the abundant Soviet-era geometric blocks strewn along the coastline.

Milach spent two years in Belarus from 2011 exploring its dire economic and political situation. Belarus is "a country caught between the ultra-traditional values of an older Soviet era and the viral influence of western popular culture." Milach was interested in the clean, tidy glamorous facade maintained by the state. His book "The Winners" (2014), portraits of winners of various "Best of Belarus" state and local contests promoted by the government, is a typology of state propaganda. It depicts mostly people, but also anonymous interiors that had won awards. The obscure official prizes are intended to foster national pride but to an outside audience might appear tragicomic. Milach travelled around the country working in the role of "an old-fashioned propaganda photographer". He was guided by the authorities as to who, where and how to photograph, a process which only improved his revealing the ideology of the state. Milach has said "the winners are everywhere, but the winnings are not for the winners – they are for the system", "the state is not interested in individuals, only in mass control."

"The First March of Gentlemen" (2017) was made on a 2016 residency at Kolekcja Września to make work about life in Września. The town is synonymous with the Września children strike, the protests of Polish children and their parents against Germanization that occurred between 1901 and 1904. In 2016, there were many demonstrations by Citizens of Poland, a civic movement engaged in pro-democracy and anti-fascist actions, opposed to the political changes brought about by the government led by the Law and Justice (PiS) party. Milach's book of collages mixes illustrations of the children strike with characters that lived in Września during the communist era in the 1950s and 1960s taken by local amateur photographer Ryszard Szczepaniak. This "delineates a fictitious narrative that can be read as a metaphor, commenting on the social and political tensions of the present day."

He is married to Ania Nałęcka-Milach.

North Milford Village Historic District

The North Milford Village Historic District is a historic district located in Milford, Michigan, including the commercial area along Main Street from the Huron River to Summit, industrial areas around the mill ponds west of Main, and residential areas east of Main. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

Milford was first settled in 1832, when Elizur and Stanley Ruggles established a sawmill here. The Ruggles sold to Stephen and John Armstrong in 1836, and the Armstrongs added a gristmill in 1839. North Milford Village was platted in 1838 by Aaron Phelps, who also dammed Pettibone Creek to create the still extant millponds. However, by the early 1840s Phelps ran into financial difficulties and sold out to the Hebbard brothers, who established an industrial park in North Milford. Soon a number of mills were located along Pettibone Creek, along with other industrial operations.

As industry grew, so did the commercial ventures along Main Street, and the residential section of town grew to house the new residents of Milford. The railroad came through Milford in 1871, causing a building boom both in the industrial and commercial enterprises now provided with an easy mode of transport. The majority of the commercial structures in Milford were built between 1872 and 1898. New stores included taverns, lumber yards, grocers and dry goods stores, drug stores, tailors, restaurants, and more. The residential section of town also expanded greatly, with Victorian houses joining the previous Greek Revival structures. New larger church buildings were also constructed.

In the twentieth century ,the rise of the automobile brought new auto-related businesses. These included service stations, but also a new Ford Motor Company plant on the mill pond, and General Motors' Milford proving grounds outside of town. Newer houses were constructed to meet the needs of the influx of workers. In the period after World War II, Milford has avoided the urban renewal process, leaving a healthy cross-section of historical structures within the district intact.

The North Milford Village Historic District consists of a three-block section of commercial buildings along Milford's North Main Street, along with adjacent residential areas along five east-west streets and six north-south streets, and the two historic mill ponds along Pettibone Creek. The district contains 312 structures, 255 of which contribute to the historical character of the district. The commercial district includes two- and three-story buildings primarily of brick and concrete block, in Italianate, Commercial brick, Tudor Revival, and Art Deco styles. The residential portion of the district contains wood frame, stone, concrete block and brick houses in a range of architectural styles, including Greek Revival, Italianate, Victorian Gothic, Late Victorian, Second Empire, Queen Anne, Stick, Chateauesque, Vernacular, Tudor Revival, Dutch Colonial Revival, Bungalow, Craftsman, English style and Cape Cod. The district also contains four historic churches.

Jean de Saint Cyr

Jean Harold (Harald) Edward de Saint Cyr (April 9, 1875 – November 3, 1966) was the alias of John (Jack) Henry Edward Thompson of Waco, Texas. He was a fortune-hunting playboy who married three older wealthy widows. The first two died while still married to him, each leaving him a sizeable inheritance. His third wife divorced him after less than a year of marriage. The Eugene J. de Sabla, Jr., Teahouse and Tea Garden that is currently on the National Register of Historic Places for San Mateo County, California was part of his estate.

He was born John (Jack) Henry Edward Thompson on April 9, 1875 in Waco, Texas. Little is known about his early life in Texas. He was living in New York by 1907. Having unsuccessfully tried his luck in a variety of jobs, including musical stage productions, he began promoting himself as a theatrical agent by the name of Jean Harold Edward de Saint Cyr. With various spellings, he used the name Saint Cyr throughout the rest of his life.

Caroline Peck Redfield was born October 3, 1840, and was 34 years older than Saint Cyr. Trenton, New Jersey resident Bob Swem (aka Robert von Schwemm) met Phoenix National Bank president Henry A. Redfield and his wife Caroline through mutual acquaintance Alfred Moore Livingstone. After her husband's February 1907 death, Caroline began relyng on Swem as a social escort. He moved into the Redfield house and made himself indispensable as her escort, secretary and accountant. He came to assume he would inherit her estate.

It is believed that Swem and Mrs. Redfield first met Saint Cyr when he worked as a hotel clerk at Alexandria Bay, New York. He presented himself as affiliated with the entertainment field, and was apparently overt that Saint Cyr was a stage name. Although his attire was that of someone down on his luck, he charmed her enough to get his foot in the door, and eventually became a permanent resident in her home. From that point forward, Saint Cyr lived the life of what was then called a "kept man", a gigolo financially supported by a wealthy woman in exchange for his relationship in her life. She bought him expensive clothing, a new car, and hired a French chauffeur and a Japanese valet for him. He began to treat the household staff as though they worked for him, and by 1908 replaced Swem in her affections. Lavishing her wealth upon both Saint Cyr and Swem severely drained her inheritance and necessitated the sale of the Redfield mansion on March 31, 1909. 

They moved to Yonkers, where she and Saint Cyr secretly wed on June 9, 1909. The bride was 68 years old, and the groom was 34 years old. Her last will was made June 18, 1912, amended by a codicil on October 2, 1913. Omitting Swem entirely, the bulk of her $1,000,000 estate was left to Saint Cyr. Her son Henry S. Redfield was bequeathed $150,000 and some valuable jewels. After her January 1915 death of pneumonia, her will was contested by her son.

Annie Armstrong Stewart Smith was born May 2, 1864, and was 11 years older than Saint Cyr. Prior to meeting him, she had lived a life of the socially elite, those whose existence revolved around traveling from one party to another, one resort to another. Her first marriage was to affluent lawyer William Rhinelander Stewart Sr. Their daughter Anita became Princess Miguel of Braganza, Duchess of Viseu. The marriage also produced a son, William Rhinelander Stewart Jr. After divorcing her first husband, she married James Henry "Silent" Smith in 1907, considered one of the world's wealthiest men. He died on their honeymoon. 

According to a friend of the Redfields, Colonel Alfred Montgomery Shook, Saint Cyr was distraught after the death of his wife Caroline. However, Major E. Gray Pendleton, who introduced him to Annie Smith a month later, said Saint Cyr was eager to resume the party lifestyle. 
Shortly after their April 25, 1915 marriage, Pendleton confronted them about reports that Saint Cyr's life prior to the Redfield marriage was that of an average working man employed in a variety of temporary professions. His new wife's response was, "I don't care what they call him, as long as they don't call me an old woman."

Saint Cyr had begun to affect a French accent, claiming to have been born near Paris. While he and his new wife were in Palm Beach, Florida in 1916, investigative journalists outted him as Jack Thompson of Texas. Happening concurrently with the exposé of his real identity, was an ongoing court battle contesting the will of Caroline Redfield. The couple denied he was Jack Thompson, but they eventually left Palm Beach amid the brewing scandal. A year later, journalists took note that he had replaced the fake French accent with a British accent.

There was an indication of a separation at some point in the marriage, but not a divorce. Upon Anne de Saint Cyr's March 3, 1925 death, they were living on an estate in San Mateo, California, that she had purchased in June 1919. It included the Eugene J. de Sabla, Jr., Teahouse and Tea Garden that is currently on the National Register of Historic Places for the county. The NRHP form states, "In 1922, upon dissolution of the second marriage, Anne sold it back to her husband." Her 1925 obituary lists Saint Cyr as her husband, sitting by her bedside with the rest of the family at the time of death. Her estate was valued at $40,000,000. Saint Cyr received one-third of the estate, and was also named as an executor of the will, and trustee over two of the estate's funds. 

As a wealthy widower, he continued the lifestyle to which he had become accustomed, among the rich and famous of his era. He hosted the 1926 wedding of actress Constance Talmadge and her second husband Alastair MacIntosh on the estate. In 1926, Jean de Saint Cyr sold the mansion and grounds to a real estate developer. The Eugene J. de Sabla, Jr. Teahouse and Tea Garden was not included in the sale. The 1928 party he hosted at the Menlo Polo Club was described as, "one of the most elaborate and unique parties given on the peninsula".

Born March 11, 1866, Helen Strong Carter was 9 years older than Saint Cyr. She was the widow of Hawaii governor George R. Carter, who died in 1933. A wealthy heiress through her father Eastman Kodak president and co-founder Henry A. Strong, and his first wife Helen Phoebe Griffin, she was known for her philanthropic generosities. She helped establish, and sat on the board of directors, of the dental hygiene program at the University of Hawaii, and the Honolulu Dental Infirmary. The Strong-Carter Dental Clinic was established to train young women for careers as dental hygienists. In 1922, Helen and her sister Gertrude made a $1,000,000 donation towards the building fund for the Strong Memorial Hospital at the University of Rochester in New York.

In what the news reports called a "surprise ceremony", Saint Cyr and Carter were wed in New Orleans on April 26, 1939, attended only by her son, one of her daughters and her son-in-law. A month after the wedding, Saint Cyr sold the teahouse and grounds to her for $400,000. It was a short-lived marriage. The couple spent September–October 1939 entertaining at her Honolulu estate. By December, she had taken up residence in Reno, Nevada to file for divorce. At the same time her attorneys claimed his "whereabouts unknown", the "Los Angeles Times" reported he was in Hollywood hosting a dinner party at the Earl Carroll Theatre for American socialite Louise Cromwell Brooks, wife of actor Lionel Atwill. The divorce was finalized February 17, 1940, and she resumed using the name Helen Strong Carter. Afterwards, she sold the Japanese teahouse and garden to developer David D. Bohannon.

By 1959, Saint Cyr was afflicted with Parkinson's disease, and was unable to care for himself. His foster son H. R. Friss was named as his conservator. Attempts to contact relatives in California and Texas received no response.

When he died November 3, 1966, the will that was probated had been executed in 1949. At the time of death, the estate was valued at $500,000. Probate proceedings listed a brother and 5 sisters. He was buried next to his second wife in San Mateo.

Jacqueline Eymar

Jacqueline Eymar (23 June 1922 – 6 Decembrer 2008) was a French classical pianist.

Born in Nice, a pupil of the pianist and composer Yves Nat, Eymar had a rich post-war career as a pianist and chamber musician.

Eymar has interpreted a wide and varied repertoire, in which the romantic period (Brahms, Schumann, Schubert…) and French music (Debussy, Fauré, Franck…) occupied a prominent place. Soloist with the Orchestre national and the Orchestre de la Radiotélévision française, she was also a regular of the major Parisian associations, playing for the Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire or in the framework of concerts Colonne and concerts Lamoureux. She has toured extensively in Europe, the USSR (1958, 1961, 1967), Southeast Asia (1965) and America (1971), offering piano recitals and chamber music concerts.

In addition to her solo work, Jacqueline Eymar has devoted a significant part of her work to chamber music, actively collaborating with – a German violinist and conductor - and with the Kehr trio, founded by the latter. At the time of the Franco-German reconciliation, they met in quartet and gave together many concerts in France, in Germany and in the world.

Critics recognized her for her exceptional power and elegance of play, most often praising her architectural design of the works. On March 30, 1960, René Dumesnil wrote in "Le Monde": "I have rarely seen such complete possession of a performer through the music she animates." On February 13, 1965, composer Luc-André Marcel addressed her in these terms: "The way in which you illuminate such and such a detail, of which you make emerge such and such a second level, of which you lead a crescendo, is of such evidence that one cannot not listen. Moreover, the extreme beauty of the sound and the astonishing variety of colours, the total absence of arbitrary, gratuitous virtuosity, add to this impression of hearing pure music."

Eymar has given great importance to contemporary composers, introducing French and foreign audiences to artists such as André Jolivet, Georges Migot, Serge Nigg, , Marius Constant and Luc-André Marcel, whose two piano concertos she created. In 1960, in the Salle Pleyel in Paris, she performed the piano concerto of Khachaturian (1926), the composer conducting the National Orchestra. 

In the 1980s, she retired to her family home in Pourrières (Var), reserving her performances for an audience of music-loving friends. She died there on December 6, 2008.

In 1961, she won the Grand Prix de l'Académie nationale du disque for the recording of "Le Zodiaque" by Georges Migot
(1932). The recording made in 1959-1960, then published in the form of two albums (Lumen LD 3443/3445) was the subject of a second edition in 1984 (Cybelia CY 665-666) and then a CD release in 2005 (Intégral).
Jacqueline Eymar's recordings are rare. Albums containing works by César Franck (Philips N 00.597 L) and Fauré, Brahms and Debussy in the series "Pages célèbres" (Le Chant du Monde LD-M-8168, LD-S-8198 and LD-S-8169). The Brahms, Fauré and Debussy records were reissued on a single CD by Forgotten Records (http://forgottenrecords.com/) and Sakuraphon ( https://www.sakuraphon.net/). In addition, her interpretation of César Franck's quintet in F minor for piano and strings with the Loewenguth Quartet (Philips L 00.381 L, 1958, recording of 1955, followed by Prélude, Choral and Fugue) remains a reference despite the years. This recording has just been republished by Forgotten Records. With the Kehr trio, she has made numerous radio recordings in Paris (ORTF) and in Germany. (Südwestrundfunk Mainz Stuttgart, Westdeutscher Rundfunk Köln, Norddeutscher Rundfunk Hannover in perticular). Together, they also recorded on disc Brahms's three quartets
(Da Camera Magna, Heidelberg, 1968) and Fauré's four quartets and quintets (1966/1970) Heinz Jansen, Südwest Tonstudio). This last disc was transcribed on CD in 1992 (VoxBox).

Rabat Zoo

Rabat Zoo ( ("Zoological Garden in Rabat"), ("The National Park for Animals in Rabat"); ), also known as Temara Zoo, is a zoological park near Rabat in Morocco. It is famous for its lions, which may have been descended from the Barbary lion that used to inhabit the wilderness of Morocco and North Africa.

Given that the Barbary lion is extinct in the wilderness, importance has been given to finding possible Barbary lions or descendants of the Barbary lion in captivity. So far, tests indicate the lions of the zoo are not pure Barbary lions, but descendants of the original Barbary lion. This is partly as members of the Moroccan royal family had kept lions that were captured from the Atlas Mountains.

FHAD1

Forkhead-associated domain containing protein 1 (FHAD1) is a protein encoded by the FHAD1 gene.

The function of this protein is not well understood. FHAD1 has 4 aliases, Forkhead associated phosphopeptide binding domain 1, Forkhead-associated (FHA) phosphopeptide binding domain 1, FHA Domain-Containing Protein 1, and KIAA1937.

In humans, FHAD1 is located on chromosome 1 (1p36.21). The genomic sequence is located on the positive strand and starts from 15236559 bp and ends at 15400283 bp.

The gene neighborhood of FHAD1 consist of 3 main genes, out of which 2 encode proteins with known functions. Two genes, EFHD2 and Chymotrypsin-C (CTRC) lie downstream of FHAD1 on the positive strand. TMEM51 lies downstream of FHAD1. 

Protein

The FHAD1 protein encoded by this gene is 16.2kDa and has 3 isoforms, namely 1, 3 and 4. It contains the following conserved regions/domains: a forkhead-associated domain that binds pSer, pThr and pTyr, two Smc regions that encode the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosome) proteins involved in replication and chromosome and chromatid segregation, and a region that encodes TMPIT-like protein annotated as being transmembrane proteins[3].

In humans specifically, it is highly expressed in the testes with some expression in the lung and stomach tissues[2].

In humans, FHAD 1 contains 42 exons, is located on chromosome 1 or 1p36.21 and spans from 15236559 bp to 15400283 bp[2]. It has 22 splice variants and 86 orthologues[2].

Pyrros Lappas

Pyrros Lappas (, 1899–1981) was a Greek Navy officer. He served in the Asia Minor Campaign, commanded warships in World War II, and assumed senior leadership positions in the post-war navy, culminating as Chief of the Hellenic Navy General Staff in 1952–1958. He then served for two years as head of the Military Household of King Paul of Greece, as General Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee in 1961–1968, and as a member of the International Olympic Committee (1965–1980).

Born in Athens in 1899, Pyrros Lappas entered the Hellenic Navy Academy on 10 October 1915 and graduated on 10 January 1920 as a Line Cadet Ensign, being promoted to full Ensign on 4 May 1920. He took part in the naval operations of the Asia Minor Campaign as a crew member of the battleship "Limnos", the destroyer "Thyella", and the cruiser "Averof", being promoted to Sub-Lieutenant on 20 may 1921.

In 1922, he completed studies at the Navy's Artillery School. During the so-called "Navy Strike" of June 1924 he resigned, but was readmitted on 28 August 1924 with full restoration of his seniority. He commanded the torpedo boat "Aigli", and was promoted to Lieutenant on 22 April 1925. He completed the Torpedo School in 1927–1928, was promoted to Lt. Commander on 22 October 1932. In 1934–1935 he commanded the torpedo boats "Kios" and "Proussa", served as commander of the Torpedo Boat Squadron (1935–1936), and of the destroyer "Spetsai" (1935). After completing staff officer studies at the Naval War School in 1937–1938, and being promoted to Commander on 22 October 1938, he was captain of the "Spetsai" again, before being placed as captain of the brand-new destroyer "Vasilefs Georgios" in 1939. At the same time, he held the post of chief of staff to the Higher Destroyer Commander. 

He held these positions during the Greco-Italian War, participating as captain of the "Vasilefs Georgios" in the first and third naval raids against Italian shipping in the Straits of Otranto (November 1940 and January 1941 respectively). During a "Luftwaffe" attack on the night of 13/14 April, the "Vasilefs Georgios" was seriously damaged, necessitating repairs in drydock. As a result, the ship was unable to join the rest of the fleet during its exodus to the Middle East, and was captured by the Germans. Lappas also remained in Greece, and was employed in the Navy General Directorate of the collaborationist government's Ministry of National Defence. In December 1941, however, he managed to flee Greece, joining the Greek Armed Forces in the Middle East on 27 February 1942.

Initially he was appointed captain of the repair ship "Ifaistos", before being sent to Britain to oversee the delivery to the Greek navy of four "Flower"-class corvettes. Likewise, in 1943 he was head of the acceptance mission for the "LST-1"-class tank landing ships in New Orleans. He personally assumed command of the LST "Samos" (L179). On 10 January 1944 he was promoted to Captain (retroactive to 9 November 1943), and took part as commander of a landing ship squadron in the Allied landing operations in Anzio (January 1944), and Southern France (August 1944). For his service as captain of the "Samos", on 14 September 1944 he received the Greek War Cross, III class. For his general war service, and especially his actions during the Anzio landings, he received the Medal for Outstanding Acts on 11 December 1945.

Following the liberation of Greece, he assumed command of the "Miaoulis" and of the 12th Destroyer Flotilla (1945–1946), the post of Higher Navy Personnel Director (1946–1947), Higher Technical Director (1947), Higher Light Craft Commander and Higher Submarine Commander in tandem (1947–1949). He then became Higher Naval Operations Commander, leading naval operations during the closing phases of the Greek Civil War, being promoted to Rear Admiral on 13 September 1949. He was then posted as Deputy Chief of the Navy General Staff in 1949, Navy Inspector-General in 1949–1950, and Chief of the Fleet Command in 1950–52. At the same time, he held in tandem the posts of Chief of the Salamis Naval Base (1951–1952) and Navy Inspector-General (1952). From 6 September 1952 he was Chief of the Navy General Staff and head of NATO's COMEDEAST, being promoted to Vice Admiral on 6 October 1952. He held the position until his retirement on 13 September 1958. 

On 13 October 1958, he was recalled to active service as head of King Paul's Military Household, holding the position until 1 November 1960. He was appointed Honorary Chief of the Navy General Staff on 15 February 1963. In addition, Lappas served as chairman of the Greek Sea Union (1958–1980), member (1953–1954 and 1969–1980) as well as general secretary (1961–1968) of the Hellenic Olympic Committee, and member of the International Olympic Committee (1965–1980).

Vincent Allègre

Vincent Gaëtan Allègre (7 August 1835 – 18 May 1899) was a French lawyer and politician. He was a radical republican and was dismissed from his position as mayor of Toulon by the monarchist ministry of Albert de Broglie in 1873. From 1876 to 1881 he was Deputy of Var. He was then Governor of Martinique from 1881 to 1887, and Senator of Martinique from 1888 until his death in 1899.

Vincent Gaëtan Allègre was born on 7 August 1835 in Six-Fours, Var.
His parents were Jean Baptiste Allègre (born 1798), a sea captain, and Henriette Alexandrine Baptistine Aycard (born 1808).
His paternal grandfather was a "garde champêtre" on the King's estates.
His family was legitimist, supporters of the Bourbon dynasty.
Vincent Allègre became a lawyer and registered at the bar of Toulon.

After the fall of the Second French Empire and its replacement by the French Third Republic on 4 September 1870 Allègre was named mayor of Toulon.
He was also a member of the Vars General Council for several years, representing the canton of Toulon West.
Allègre was a radical Republican, a supporter of the Paris Commune, who protested the executions of Louis Rossel and Gaston Crémieux in November 1871 and veiled the tricolour flag at the Town Hall as a sign of mourning.
Under the first ministry of the monarchist Albert de Broglie he was dismissed from his office as mayor on 24 May 1873.

Allègre ran for election on 20 February 1876 as Deputy of Var for the 2nd constituency of Toulon and was elected in the second round by 7,361 votes out of 8,227.
He was reelected on 14 October 1877.
His election manifesto pledged him to demand amnesty for the Communards and separation of church and state.
He sat with the Republican Union and followed the policy of the Opportunist Republicans led by Léon Gambetta.
He voted with the majority for invalidation of the election of Louis Auguste Blanqui, for return of the Assembly to Paris, for application of existing laws to congregations, for free and compulsory primary education and for the vote of confidence in the Jules Ferry ministry on 11 November 1880.

On 20 July 1881, a few days before the next general elections, Allègre accepted the position of Governor of Martinique and resigned as deputy.
In December 1881 Allègre said the clergy of the island was aligned with "the small reactionary minority", and Bishop Carméné had agreed with "parties hostile to the Republic" to make out that the colony was totally disorganized.
On 17 December 1882 Allègre was elected Senator of Martinique in place of Joseph Desmazes, who had died.
He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour on 24 December 1882.

He was a member of the Colonial committee and vice-president of the Naval Committee.
He spent most of his time on colonial issues including finance, economy and tariff administration.
In 1889 he was involved in the question of improving French seaports.

In 1891 Martinique was devastated by a hurricane. 
A commission of members of the General Council undertook an investigation of damages that Allègre described as "meticulous" and estimated the total costs were almost 89 million francs.
The central government considered this estimate to be extreme, as did the business elite of Paris, and reduced the estimated to 72 million francs.
A commission of outside investigators led by Jean-Baptiste Chaudié further reduced the estimate to 50 million francs.
Allegre wrote to the colonial office of the Ministry of Marine protesting that the outside inspectors did not understand the true losses of Martinique's "energetic popuation who, in trying to lift itself up, will use up its last resources and count on the future as well as the goodwill of the mother country."
Allegre continued to pressure the government to arrange a loan to fund reconstruction and to provide tariff relief on sugar and tafia exports.

In 1892–93 Allègre participated in discussions on recruitment and organization of the colonial army.
He also defended small rural landholdings.
Due to failing health he moved to the calm of Mèze, Hérault, where he died in office on 18 May 1899.

Society of Ephors

The Society of Ephors, or Société des Ephores, was a late 19th century French political group established in the aftermath of the defeat of the Second Empire in the Franco-Prussian War under the aegis of the second President of the Republic, Marshal Patrice MacMahon. Leaders like MacMahon, who some considered reactionary supporters of the French throne, did not call or move to reinstall the monarchy and instead supported the Third Republic and acknowledged its legitimacy. This support was qualified, however, by strong nationalist, imperialist urges and an emphasis on military/technological progress to redress perceived French industrial lag relative to other great powers. As formal, national political parties developed in later years as the Third Republic stabilized, political clubs, like Le Société des Ephores, were subsumed into them.

Unlike other political clubs, especially the most radical left ones centered on Paris, the group’s major support was found in provincial towns and France’s secondary cities. This mirrored Napoleon III’s widespread backing from rural peasantry but sought to add moderate bourgeouis elements who were disaffected with both Napoleon III’s regime and the potentially revolutionary program espoused by the Paris Commune.
The club was founded in Toulon in 1873 by former officers of the French Foreign Legion and other veterans of Napoleon III’s campaigns who borrowed the name from the ancient Spartan government council. Their inaugural meeting place in Toulon, Place de la Liberté, can still be visited.

The Society’s founding motto was, Liberté, Progrès, Etat (Liberty, Progress, State). Many of their initial concerns stemmed from specific military deficiencies they had first-hand experienced against the Prussians like the quality of German Krupp howitzers relative to French artillery, the gap between railroad and railhead concentrations in France compared to Germany and Great Britain that inhibited French forces from concentrating or maneuvering quickly, and the employment of a small-scale, long-service professional army instead of a draft/conscription system that left France defenseless after the war’s initial defeats destroyed most of the Second Empire’s armies. 

Politically, the society backed the government of Patrice MacMahon and balked at the restoration a French monarch, partially because of the division amongst monarchist ranks over which family (Orleans, Bourbon, or Bonaparte) should accede to the throne. As fervor for the monarchist cause receded as the 1870s progressed, the society gradually shifted towards support for the Opportunist Republican governments who had themselves staked out more of a claim on the political center.

Burmacyrtus is an extinct genus of small-headed flies of uncertain placement. The genus is known from Upper Cretaceous fossils in amber from Myanmar. It contains only one species, Burmacyrtus rusmithi.

The genus was originally placed in the family Acroceridae, though was later reassessed and considered not to be an acrocerid. Instead, it could possibly be a stem group acrocerid or placed in Heterodactyla.

The generic name is a combination of "Burma" (another name for Myanmar) and "Cyrtus", an extant genus. The species is named in honor of R.D.A. Ru Smith, who donated the holotype to the AMNH from his personal collection.

Filipino Comfort Woman Statue

The Filipino Comfort Woman Statue was a statue installed near Roxas Boulevard in Manila. Unveiled on December 8, 2017 and installed through the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) and other donors and foundations, it was dedicated to the Filipino "comfort women", who were coerced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. 

Since its installation it has garnered support from concerned groups, and criticism from government agencies. The statue was removed on April 27, 2018, which has received backlash.

The statue was located near along Baywalk within Manila's Ermita district. It was among the many statues and memorials scattered along the boulevard.

The statue consists of a bronze statue designed by Jonas Roces and a historical marker installed by the NHCP. The bronze statue is two meters tall, depicting a representation of an estimated 1,000 Filipinas who have undergone sexual slavery during World War II. It depicts a grieving blindfolded woman in traditional Maria Clara attire. The pedestal features the historical marker on its front, while its back cites the effort and donations of groups and individuals. On the base of the backside is a small plaque, with the title of the statue as ""Filipina Comfort Women"" and the name of its designer.

Before the statue's installation, a historical marker remembering the comfort women was installed along Liwasang Bonifacio by the city government of Manila on April 22, 2003. It was unveiled by then-Mayor Lito Atienza.

The statue was commissioned by Manuel Chua of Tulay Foundation, Inc. After Chua's death, the NHCP successfully sought Teresita Ang See approval for the statue's installation. Other donors and partners, according to its pedestal backside, include Lila Pilipina, Manuel O. Chua, Dee Kong Hi, and Wai Ming Charitable Foundation Fund Company Limited.

Around 2014, the Tulay Foundation approached the Manila city government to request a place, where the statue could be installed.

The National Historical Commission of the Philippines led the installation of the Filipino Comfort Woman Statue with the city government of Manila providing a place for the statue as well as technical support. The statue was formally unveiled in December 8, 2017.
Days after the installation, the statue caught the attention of the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) which formally sought an explanation from officials of Manila City Hall and the NHCP regarding details of the installation of the statue through a letter tagged as "extremely urgent". The DFA cites the sensitivity of the "comfort women issue" within domestic matters and bilateral affairs with Japan. Officials from the Japanese embassy also went to the Manila City Hall. The city government of Manila said that it only provided the space, while the NHCP facilitated its installation.

Seiko Noda, the Japanese minister for Internal Affairs and Communications, aired her dismay to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Teresita Ang See, a prominent member of the Filipino-Chinese community wrote to the DFA, and said that the statue is not meant as an insult against the Japanese people. She also said that this serves as a timely memorial, given that many women have come out in the West against violence upon them. 

In January 2018, Duterte said that he respects the freedom of expression of groups for this statue. However, Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano aired his grievances over the Philippines' relationship with Japan.

On April 27, 2018, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) removed the statue, along with two others, for a drainage improvement project along the Baywalk. Many individuals and groups, including Gabriela Women's Party condemned the removal, stating their opposition to historical revisionism and submission to Japanese policy. They also stated that this has been an unlawful removal, since the heritage act protects markers and memorials by the NHCP. President Duterte remarked that the memorial can be placed in a private property, since the state would not want to "antagonize" other countries.

The marker, entitled Memorare, was installed by the NHCP along with the statue. The marker text is written in Filipino.

Natalya Armfeldt

Natalya Alexandrovna Armfeldt (Наталья Алексаӊдровӊа Армѳельдт) (1850-1887) was one of the first Russian revolutionaries to resort to political violence in opposition to the Tsar's regime. She was sentenced to hard labour and deported to Siberia, where she contracted tuberculosis.

Natalya Armfeldt's father was Professor Alexander Armfeldt (1839-1897), one of Russia's leading specialists in cattle breeding. He arranged for her to study mathematics at Heidelburg University.

Natalya Armfeldt abandoned her studies in 1874, to join the movement among idealistic Russian students and graduates to leave the cities and 'go to the people' to learn about and try to improve the lives of the peasants. She joined an illegal socialist group in Moscow, and set out to a village in Orel province, but was arrested and deported back to Moscow. In 1875, she was exiled by administrative order to Kostroma. When her term of exile ended, in 1877, she settled illegally in Ukraine, and joined the Kiev "buntari", or 'Southern Rebels', but was arrested with three other members of the group on 11 February 1879, after a gun battle with Kiev police in which a gendarme was killed and two of the rebels, Ivan Ivichevich and his brother, were fatally wounded. She was tried, with 13 other "buntari" and sentenced to 14 years and ten months hard labour.

Natalya Armfeldt was deported to the Kara katorga in eastern Siberia, close to the Chinese border, where she was among dozens of political prisoners forced to work in privately owned mines, in harsh conditions. She fell ill with tuberculosis. In 1883, she and two other prisoners were offered pardons if they would renounce their views and admit their 'errors'. She refused the offer. 
In 1884, her mother, Anna Armfeldt appealed for help from Leo Tolstoy (the author of "War and Peace") to get permission to settle in Kara to look after her daughter. Tolstoy wrote to his aunt, Alexandrine, who was well connected at the court of the Tsar Alexander III, asking her to take up the case, but permission was not granted.. But in 1885, she was released from work in the mines, but confined to political exile in the Kara district.

Anna Armfeldt then approached the American explorer George Kennan, who had a commission to survey Siberia, and persuaded him to smuggle a manuscript copy of Tolstoy's banned "Confession" to her daughter. Kennan carried out the assignment early in November 1885, giving the authorities the slip in order to visit the 'miserable' cabin where she lived. She asked him to return that evening, by which time she had assembled a group of political exiles, who shared their stories with Kennan. This meeting inspired Kennan's classic study, "Siberia and the Exile System", which first alerted opinion abroad to the ill-treatment of Russia's political prisoners.

She died of tuberculosis in exile in 1887.

Dhaka-10 is a constituency represented in the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament) of Bangladesh since 2008 by Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh of the Awami League.

The constituency encompasses Dhaka South City Corporation wards 14 through 18, inclusive, and 22.

The constituency was created for the first general elections in newly independent Bangladesh, held in 1973.

Ahead of the 2008 general election, the Election Commission redrew constituency boundaries to reflect population changes revealed by the 2001 Bangladesh census. The 2008 redistricting altered the boundaries of the constituency.

Sheikh Fazle Noor Taposh was elected unopposed in the 2014 general election after opposition parties withdrew their candidacies in a boycott of the election.

Abdul Mannan resigned from parliament in March 2004 to join a new political party, Bikalpa Dhara Bangladesh. Mannan's resignation triggered a July 2004 by-election, in which Mohammad Mosaddak Ali of the BNP was elected.

Archibald Ingram

Archibald Ingram (1699–1770) was an 18th century tobacco lord who served as Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1762 to 1764. Ingram Street in the city centre was named in his honour in 1781.

He was born in or near Glasgow in 1699.

He began trading in tobacco around 1720 and (as was common) began his own plantations.

In 1742 he gained a younger partner, his brother-in-law John Glassford, and in 1750 they created Ingram & Glassford, a powerful trading company. They made their fortune as tobacco lords, with plantations in the east coast of America.

He was involved in the creation of the Glasgow Arms Bank and the Pollokshaws Calico Printing Company and the Inkle Company. He was described as the father of the calico printing industry in Scotland, specifically created as a "return product" for the ship returning to America for more tobacco.

From 1752 he was the financial backer of the Foulis Academy created by the printers Andrew Foulis and Robert Foulis. The Academy was created on the High Street in an upper room owned by the Glasgow College.

In 1757 he sold 3 acres of land at Gallowmuir to the Town council for £1695 (Scots).

Prior to being elected Lord Provost in 1762 he was Dean of Guild to the city.

He died in Glasgow in 1770. He is thought to be buried in the Ramshorn Cemetery (near Ingram Street). As he died before the American Revolution of 1776 he avoided the financial ruin which befell most of his peers.

Without his financial support the Foulis Academy failed in 1774.

Ljubica Čakarević (Serbian language, Љубица Чакаревић–Ди Сорно; later, Ljubica Čakarević-Di Sorno; 1894–1980) was a Serbian combatant and heroine in World War I.

Ljubica Čakarević was born in Užice, in 1894. In her early career, she worked as a teacher. When the war broke out, she became a nurse at the Military Hospital in Užice with her sister Milica. She refused to work as a teacher during the occupation. With the group led by Dragutin Jovanović-Luno she arrived at the Salonika Front, after 23 days of evading Bulgarian ambushes, and brought the Serbian command valuable information from the occupied homeland. Field Marshals Stepa Stepanović and Živojin Mišić, whom she met at the front, told her that she was the first messenger from Serbia. For this feat, she was awarded the golden medal for bravery “Miloš Obilić“.

After the war ended, Čakarević returned to teaching. In 1921, she married Nikola Di Sorno, son of Italian diplomat Dionisi, who was a consul in Belgrade. They had one child, a daughter, Ida. In the following years, the family lived in Rome, Genoa, and Milan. In 1980, Čakarević came to visit her brother Milutin in Sarajevo where she got sick and died. She was buried in the city's Bare Cemetery. In 2016, her remains were transferred from Sarajevo to her native Užice and she was buried in a family tomb at the Dovarja Cemetery. One street in Uzice is named after her.

They lived at Oak Lodge, Little Marsden, near Nelson, where their first three children were all born. These were Mary Cicely (February 1880), Gilbert (August 1881) and Margaret Farrer (known as "Meta") (1884). They subsequently moved to Montford Hall, near Fence, where the couple had five more daughters, Edith Dorothea ("Dolly"), Rosamond, Alice Ecroyd, Gertrude Adelaide (Gertie) and Constance Sybil (Sybil).

Lady Trample

Lady Trample (born 1991), real name Samara Pepperell, is a roller derby skater from New Zealand. Winner of the Most Valuable Player award at the 2017 WFTDA Championships, she is also the founder of the Chicks in Bowls organisation.

Born in Auckland in New Zealand, Pepperell worked as a graphic designer with a fibre company. She began roller skating with a friend in 2011, and the experience of learning led her to form Chicks in Bowls, initially a small group of friends who attended skate parks. The brand grew rapidly, and by 2014 there were more than 120 chapters on five continents.

In 2012, Pepperell joined the local Pirate City Rollers, and was soon rostered to play for the league. She chose the derby name "Lady Trample" from her love of Disney films, punning on "The Lady and the Tramp". The league won the 2013 New Zealand Championship, at which she was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player. At the 2014 Roller Derby World Cup, she played for Team New Zealand.

Trample transferred to the Victorian Roller Derby League (VRDL) in 2015, moving to Melbourne in Australia. This represented a significant step up in level of play from Pirate City, and in 2017 the league won the WFTDA Championships, the first non-U.S. league to do so. Trample was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament.

Trample competed for the renamed Aotearoa Roller Derby at the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup, at which she won the Tournament Fan Favourite award.

<doc id="57285653" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57285653" title="Publius Pasidienus Firmus">
Publius Pasidienus Firmus

Publius Pasidienus Firmus was a Roman senator, who was active during the reign of Nero. He was suffect consul in the second quarter of 65 as the colleague of Aulus Licinius Nerva Silianus, replacing Marcus Julius Vestinus Atticus whom Nero forced to commit suicide. Firmus is known entirely from inscriptions.

Pasidienus is a rare gentilicum. Bernard Remy believes it is Etruscan in origin. However, noting that the suffix "-enus" was typical of names from Picenum and the vicinity, other authorities believe that the Pasidieni were of Picentine or Umbrian descent.

Based on a fragmentary inscription, Attilio Degrassi identified Firmus with the ordinary consul for the year, Nerva Silianus, arguing that Nerva Silianus had a polyonymous name. Some authorities were uncomfortable this identification, since it presumed Firmus had been adopted by a member of the patrician Licinii Nerae, which would lead to a number of problems. The discovery of a military diploma dated to 18 June of the consulship of Nerva Silianus and Pasidienus Firmus decisively proved they were two different men.

This strengthened the likely identification of Firmus with the identically named proconsular governor of Bithynia and Pontus. He is known from coins minted in Nicomedia, and a Greek inscription erected by Nicea and Nicomedia to memorialize him as their patron. This Firmus is thought to have governed the public province for two years during the reign of Claudius; Remy offers a specific for his tenure, from the year 48 to 50. Remy connects his lengthy tenure to the victorious campaign (in 48-49) of Gaius Julius Aquila in the Cimmerian Bosphorus against Mithridates, the former king of Bosphorus, a campaign to which Claudius and his advisers attributed exceptional importance by awarding excessive rewards to the victorious generals. If these two are the same man, this would suggest that Firmus came to the consulate much late in life, 15 years after his governing Bithynia and more than 20 years after he was praetor, typical for a "homo novus". 

It is clear that he is related to Lucius Pasidienus Firmus, suffect consul in 75. If the younger Firmus were his son, the unusually brief period between their consulates would help confirm the theory he came to the consulate late in life. However, it is equally possible the younger Firmus could be a nephew or a cousin.

Manzaz volcanic field

Manzaz volcanic field is a volcanic field in Algeria. It consists of scoria cones with lava flows and has been active until recently.

The field lies in Hoggar, close to the Atakor volcanic field. A dome-like uplift has been associated with the volcanism in the region. The presence of volcanism has been explained by tectonic events associated with the collision between Europe and Africa, and the resulting reactivation of ancient tectonic lineaments.

The field consists of scoria cones and covers a surface of . Many of these have breaches and are heavily eroded. The cones were strombolianically active and have erupted lava flows. Ash and pyroclastics are also found. Oukcem is a maar in the field that consists of two separate craters with diametres of and respectively. They are surrounded by tuffs and natron is found at the bottom of the larger crater.

The basement consists of metamorphic and plutonic rocks of Precambrian age, which are part of the Tuareg shield. Outcrops of granite are found in some places. These were first buried by tholeiitic basalts between 35 and 30 million years ago.

The field has mostly erupted basalt and basanite. Xenoliths include peridotite and pyroxenite, and amphibole and feldspar form megacrysts in the rocks. Xenoliths appear to, in part, originate from a metasomatized mantle. The total volume of erupted rocks is about .

Three phases of volcanic activity have been distinguished at Manzaz, the first between 20 and 12 million years ago, the second between 7 and 4 million years ago and the third between 3 and 0.01 million years ago. Volcanic activity continued into the Holocene. Some young volcanoes developed on terraces of Neolithic age.

1932–33 Southampton F.C. season

The 1932–33 season was the 38th season of competitive football by Southampton, and the club's 11th in the Second Division of the Football League. It was another disappointing campaign for the Saints, who finished mid-table and rarely competed for promotion to the First Division. After a slow start to the season, the club had established themselves in the top half of the table by October with a string of victories. By the end of the calendar year, Southampton had dropped as low as 14th in the Second Division table – the position in which they finished the previous season – after a period of poor form in December. Wins were hard to come by in the second half of the season, but a strong run of results in April meant that the side finished 12th with 18 wins, five draws and 19 losses, seven points above the first relegation place.

In the 1932–33 FA Cup, Southampton were drawn away to fellow Second Division side Stoke City. The Potters, who were challenging for the league championship at the time (and eventually won it), edged the game 1–0 to send the Saints out of the third round of the tournament for the sixth consecutive season, marking their worst run to date. The club ended the season against local rivals Portsmouth in a single game for the Hampshire Benevolent Cup and Rowland Hospital Cup, which they lost 5–0 at Fratton Park. They also competed in the second annual Hampshire Combination Cup, losing 6–0 to Pompey in the semi-final. Southampton played another two friendly matches during the campaign, losing to Third Division South side Gillingham in February and beating a side representing the Tidworth Garrison in March.

Southampton used 21 different players during the 1932–33 season and had twelve different goalscorers. Their top scorer was centre-forward Ted Drake, who scored 20 goals in the Second Division. Outside-left Johnny Arnold, top scorer in the previous season, scored eleven times, followed by inside-right Tom Brewis on ten goals. Eight players were signed by the club during the campaign, with 17 released and sold to other clubs. The average attendance at The Dell during the 1932–33 season was 8,779, their lowest in the Football League to date. The highest attendance of the season was 11,862 against Stoke City on 12 November 1932. The lowest attendance was a record low 2,949 against Bradford City on 25 February 1933, the first home game after the controversial sale of Arnold and left-back Michael Keeping.

Due to mounting financial problems, Southampton were forced to sell numerous players after the end of the 1931–32 season. Amongst those transferred were centre-forward Arthur Haddleton, outside-right Bert Jepson and inside-right Bill Fraser, all of whom joined Fulham, who had recently been promoted to the Second Division from the Third Division South. Half-back Arthur Wilson was sold to recently-relegated West Ham United for £500, goalkeeper Willie White joined Third Division South side Aldershot, inside-left Peter Dougall was transferred to French side Sète, centre-half Johnny McIlwaine joined Welsh club Llanelli for a season, and inside-forward Henry O'Grady signed for Leeds United in the First Division. The club also sold reserve players Fred Allan and Chris Crossley, while Frank Matson was forced to retire due to problems with his eyesight. The end of the season also marked the end of the playing career of right-half Bert Shelley, who had made a then-club record 465 appearances in all competitions since he joined in 1919 (the record remained until 1964, when it was surpassed by left-back Tommy Traynor). Shelley remained at Southampton as a trainer for the youth team.

Alongside the host of departures, Southampton made a number of low-key signings in the summer of 1932. The first arrival was goalkeeper Billy Light, who joined from Harland and Wolff on amateur terms and did not turn professional until more than a year later. Outside-right Fred Dunmore was signed for the reserve team from Derby County in June, when Accrington Stanley goalkeeper Bob Foster was also signed. Winger Jimmy Harris joined from West Ham United in July, followed by centre-forward Norman Cole from Newport (Isle of Wight) in August. After the season had started, inside-left Tom Ruddy was signed from Chesterfield. Also in September, Willie Haines was sold to Weymouth, George Harkus joined Southport as reserve player-coach, and Sid Grover signed for Bournemouth Gasworks Athletic. Half-back Cyril King signed from Plymouth United on amateur terms in November. In February, with the club still suffering financial problems, Fulham bought outside-left Johnny Arnold and left-back Michael Keeping for a combined fee of £5,100. After the arrival of Keeping, Fulham sent regular left-back Arthur Tilford in return to Southampton on a temporary basis.

Southampton began the 1932–33 season at the bottom of the Second Division table following a 3–0 opening day loss against promotion hopefuls Millwall. A 2–2 home draw with Port Vale was followed by high-profile wins over Manchester United and Bury (as well as a return win over Port Vale), which helped the side move up to seventh in the table. During the opening few months of the campaign, three different players scored their first hat-tricks for the club – Tom Brewis in the 4–2 win against Manchester United, Johnny Arnold in a 4–3 victory over West Ham United and Ted Drake in a 3–0 defeat of Grimsby Town. By the end of the calendar year, the club had dropped to the middle of the table after three straight defeats in December against Burnley, Nottingham Forest and Charlton Athletic. Strong home form – including a club record 15 out of 21 home wins – helped the club secure their Second Division safety relatively comfortably, and they finished in 12th place on 18 wins, five draws and 19 losses.

With the club's financial difficulties continuing to pose problems for the directors, Southampton were forced to sell Johnny Arnold and left-back Michael Keeping in February, both of whom had played in all but two games in the league campaign to date. They joined recently departed players Arthur Haddleton, Bert Jepson, Bill Fraser and former Saints boss Jimmy McIntyre at Fulham, who later described the purchase as "the best deal he had ever made". The sale proved unpopular with fans, who responded with a club record low Football League attendance of 2,949 in the next home match against Bradford City, after the directors had warned that an average crowd of 14,000 was required for the rest of the season in order to break even. In an attempt to increase crowd sizes at The Dell, the Southampton Supporters Club offered to pay admission for unemployed supporters; however, with the exception of the following week's fixture against Tottenham Hotspur, attendance exceeded 8,000 just once more during the season.

￺

Southampton entered the 1932–33 FA Cup in the third round against Stoke City, who at the time were third in the Second Division league table. The visiting Saints put up a "spirited performance" against the soon-to-be league champions at the Victoria Ground, and saw a header from Ted Drake cleared off the goal line in the first half, but were defeated by a single goal three minutes into the second half. Southampton were unable to find an equaliser, and as a result were eliminated in the third round of the tournament for the fifth consecutive season – their worst run in the competition to date.

Outside of the league and the FA Cup, Southampton played four additional first-team matches during the 1932–33 season. The first was the semi-final of the second annual Hampshire Combination Cup against local rivals Portsmouth on 5 October, which the First Division side won 6–0 at Fratton Park. Pompey were three up by half-time thanks to a brace for Fred Worrall and a goal by centre-forward McCarthy, before Jimmy Nichol scored twice and Worrall completed his hat-trick after the break. The performance of Septimus Rutherford was praised by reporters, who described him as "a very dangerous winger". The club's first non-competitive fixture of the season was a friendly match against Third Division South side Gillingham in February, which they lost 3–1 (Arthur Holt scored for the Saints).

A second friendly followed in March, against a team representing the Tidworth Garrison, which Southampton won 3–1. The club ended their season with another match against Portsmouth on 3 May, which served as a combined fixture for the Hampshire Benevolent Cup and Rowland Hospital Cup, with both charities sharing the proceeds from the game. The Saints were on the end of another thrashing at the hands of the top-flight hosts, who won 5–0 thanks to another hat-trick from Worrall, as well as a first-half goal from Jack Weddle and a second-half own-goal by right-half Charlie Sillett.

Southampton used 21 different players during the 1932–33 season, twelve of whom scored during the campaign. The team played in a 2–3–5 formation throughout, using two full-backs, three half-backs, two outside forwards, two inside forwards and a centre-forward. Left-half Bill Luckett played in all 45 of the club's games during the campaign. Outside-right Dick Neal and goalkeeper Bert Scriven each appeared in all but one of the season's league games and the match for the Hampshire Benevolent and Rowland Hospital Cups. Centre-forward Ted Drake finished as the season's top scorer with 20 goals in the Second Division, followed by outside-left Johnny Arnold on eleven goals and inside-forward Tom Brewis on ten. Luckett was the highest-scoring half-back of the season on five goals, and Michael Keeping was the highest-scoring full-back on two.

Notes

<doc id="57285800" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57285800" title="Antonio Foscarini">
Antonio Foscarini

Antonio Foscarini (c. 1570 in Venice , d. April 22, 1622) belonged to the Venetian nobility and was Venetian ambassador to Paris and later to London . He was the third son of Nicolò di Alvise of the family branch of San Polo and Maria Barbarigo di Antonio. In 1622 he was sentenced to death for high treason by the Council of Ten and executed.

Ten months later, the same council rehabilitated Antonio Foscarini and explicitly informed the European courts of his posthumous exoneration, and the revocation of the guilty verdict and death sentence. Notwithstanding the about turn, mystery still remains as to why an art-loving nobleman was embroiled in a Venetian tale of political intrigue, that involved factional infighting, institutional disputes between Church and State, and religious hostilities over Protestantism and Catholicism at the beginning of the Thirty Years' War, that led to the death of an innocent man.

Antonio Foscarini had two brothers, Alvise (1560-1617) and Girolamo (1561-1580), and three sisters, Caterina, Agnesina, and Luca Contarini. The Foscarini family lost a substantial part of their wealth, from the Ottoman–Venetian War (1570–1573) and only the sons received financial support. His father Nicolò died in 1575, and his mother died in 1582, probably by suicide.

Antonio studied in Padua, where he made several lifelong friendships. From 1590 he and his remaining brother Alvise led the household, and in 1592 they agreed to share the considerable fortune of about 70,000 ducats that remained. The family property included estates in Padua, Mestrino, Verona and Venice, including the family home in San Polo. In 1595 Foscarini gained a seat in the Grand Council and in September 1597 was elected to the 'Savio agli Ordini', - the lowest level in the council of ministers the 'Collegio' - where he was witness to the factional infighting between 'conservatives' and 'innovators', the two opposing groups of the nobility. He became a supporter of the 'innovator' Paolo Sarpi.
Foscarini began his political career as an envoy to the court of Henry IV of France in 1601. and was present at the king's marriage to Maria de Medici. On May 26, 1607 he was appointed as ambassador to France but did not assume the role until February the next year. In July 1610 he was made ambassador to England, but here too he did not take up the position until May 4 of the following year.

These delays in taking up his two appointments formed part of the accusations against him during his two trials, but it was found that he otherwise behaved befittingly. Accusations that he was poorly dressed and was stingy were not trivial matters in the estates society. His opposition to the Pope and the Jesuit order was no secret. 

In February 1615 the secretary, Giulio Muscorno, denounced Foscarini before the Council of Ten, accusing him of selling secrets to his political opponent Spain. When Muscorno returned to Venice in March, his replacement, Giovanni Rizzardo, was requested to secretly gather evidence against Foscarini. Foscarini was arrested on his arrival in Venice in December. Three years later he was released without charge and formally absolved on July 30, 1618. In London between January 1616 and June 1617 his successor as ambassador to England, Gregorio Barbarigo, and his secretary Lionello, had searched in vain for evidence against him. In 1620 Foscarini was elected to the senate.

In 1621, Alethea Howard, Countess of Arundel, reached Venice. She was the granddaughter of Elizabeth of Hardwick, a goddaughter of Queen Elizabeth I, and wife of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, a leading person at the court of King James I of England. Foscarini was a friend of the art-loving couple from London and visited the pair at the the Palazzo Mocenigo on the Grand Canal where they were staying.

On April 8, 1622 Foscarini was arrested leaving the Senate. The Council of Ten accused him of meeting with ministers of foreign powers, both in Venice and abroad, and of betraying in words and in writing the most intimate secrets of the Republic. Foscarini was accused of disclosing state secrets to the secretary of Emperor Ferdinand II and to the nuncio of the Pope at the Arundel residence. The agents of the State Inquisition, Domenico and Girolomo Vano were the key witnesses. These, in turn, had received their information from Gian Battista, the servant of the Spanish Ambassador.

Sir Henry Wotton, England's ambassador to Venice, wrote to Arundel that the Senate would declare her an 'unwanted person' and advising her to leave the city immediately. Instead, she hurried to the ambassador and requested an audience with Doge Antonio Priuli. She threatened the Ambassador, whom she suspected of being involved in the action of the Council of Ten, to call for her removal. In fact, she was not only admitted to the Doge, but he assured her that no one wanted to banish her, and promised to restore the honor of Foscarini by writing to London. Six months later she left Venice, endowed with doge's presents.

Despite assurances of the Doge given to the countess, on April 22, Foscarini was convicted. He was strangled in jail and his body was, in the manner usual for those convicted of high treason, hung head down between the pillars in the Piazzetta. Before being so hung, his body had been dragged along the ground, from morning to dusk by one leg.

Meanwhile, one of the inquisitors was suspicious and had interrogated the Spanish servant further, whereby he confessed to not having seen Foscarini in the Spanish ambassador's house. Girolamo, who had received a salary on May 23 for services not mentioned, and Domenico Vano, were both summoned and interviewed in August. They confessed to a conspiracy to discredit Foscarini, but the redacted court records reveal no motive, nor who may have been behind the conspiracy.

The Vano pair were convicted but before they were executed, the Foscarini nephews, Nicolò and Girolamo Foscarini, had petitioned the Council of Ten for further interrogation to reveal any co-conspirators, but this was declined. The English ambassador suspected this suggested either the statements of the convicted were of no value, or there were reasons of state.[1]

On 16 January 1623, ten months after the the Council of Ten had convicted Antonio Foscarini of high treason, he was exonerated of all charges by the same council.[2]

The prosecutors were brought before the State Inquisition and the Council of Ten. The latter publicly acknowledged their error. Copies of the corresponding letters were sent to the Foscarini family and to all the estates in Europe. 

Foscarini was exhumed and reburied with a state funeral. A statue was erected in the Foscarini Chapel in the church of San Stae on the Grand Canal. The Doge Marco Foscarini (1762-1763), a descendant of Antonio's brother Alvise, praised the Council of Ten for revoking its earlier judgment.

Antonio Foscarini was a follower of the so-called 'Giovani', a group in the Venetian nobility with sympathy for the Protestant rulers who supported them during the Thirty Years' War. When Foscarini was an ambassador to London, he made friends with Sir Henry Wotton (later to become British ambassador to Venice) and formed a formal alliance with England.

In addition, Venice had drawn the consequences in a lawsuit since 1605 and banished Theatines, Capuchins and Jesuits from its dominion. In return, the Pope had imposed on 17 April 1606, the Interdict on Venice. When this was abolished in 1607, the Jesuits were not allowed to return. The Venetian Republic challenged Papal authority and mistrusted the Jesuit order, with its strong Spanish ties. Venice resented Spanish power and her league with Florence, Milan and Naples. Savoy was the only other Italian state not subject to Spanish supremacy. Paolo Sarpi led an anti-papal group, opposing temporal privileges of the Pope.

The conflict between the 'Giovani' (the boys), and their opponents, 'Il Vecchi', (the ancients), also Papists was an important background to Foscarini's conviction. Until the death of Doge Leonardo Donato (1606-1612), 'the boys' dominated, but until 1631 they had intermittent influence.

The Habsburgs, leaders of the Counter-Reformation forces, involved Venice in a war under the leadership of Archduke Ferdinand, who in 1617 entered into the Treaty of Madrid. The Spanish Viceroy in Naples, the Duke of Osuna, refused to surrender. While his ships attacked Venetian merchants in the Adriatic, rumors circulated in Venice that the Spanish embassy was forming a core of supporters against the city. Many Venetians gathered before the embassy and the courts condemned more than a hundred men for treason. Three Spaniards were executed immediately.

The coup attempt sparked strong anti-Spanish sentiment in Venice even among pro-papal groups. Significantly Giambattista Bragadino, a member of the impoverished nobility, the so-called Barnabotti, having confessed to contact with the Spanish ambassador, was also executed. With the crowd surrounding the embassy, the Spanish Ambassador, the Marquess of Bedmar, decided to leave the city.

The denunciation of Antonio Foscarini by his secretary Giulio Muscarno, and subsequent arrest in 1615 had come in the midst of this crisis. He was eventually acquitted of selling information to the Spaniards but only after three years in detention. Muscarno was stripped of his office and sentenced to two years in prison.

Foscarini's second denunciation in 1622 may have arisen from first indictment, his Protestant sympathies, the antipathy of of his secretary Muscarno, or the general fear of Spain's intrigue, but which of these, is impossible to ascertain. 

Since 1310 the Council of the Ten dealt with cases of high treason. For both important dates, the day of the conviction (22 April 1622) and day of the rehabilitation (16 January 1623), the composition of the Council of the Ten is known. This Council of Ten, which had six councilors in addition to the Doge, consisted of ten senators, although a total of 17 men participated at the meetings. From their circle these determined three administrators of state, or 'Avogadori di Commun', one of whom would be a council of the Doge, the other two were elected by the senators. The three 'Avogadori' retained numerous informers, informants and henchmen, paid for from their own cash funds, and kept no records. The senate election to the Council were for one year terms, but the term commencement dates varied, so the Council composition changed monthly, but gradually.

Doge Antonio Priuli, Alvise Contarini, Francesco Molin and Battista Nani were all possible Papists, but the number of Papist members of the Council in 1622 cannot be determined.

In 1623, the presidents, (Capi), were Anzolo da Mosto, Marcantonio Mocenigo and Nicolò Contarini. According to Sarpi, Contarini was one of the brains of the Giovani, and Mocenigo supported them. Only Battista Nani, the third to sign the rehabilitation, was not one of them. Nani had been in the Council of Ten at the time of the sentencing of 1622, but had been one of four who voted for imprisonment and not execution.

Vincenzo Dandolo, like Nani, was present at both sessions. He was an old acquaintance of Contarini and probably owed him his Senate seat, and they had fought together in the Gradisca War 1615-1617. He had sought the harshest condemnation, and in 1623, voted for rehabilitation. 

Whether the 'Giovani' and 'Papalisti' rivalry was behind the execution and rehabilitation is unkown. In 1622 Foscarini was so discredited that Paolo Sarpi had publicly declined the 100 [ducats]] from the legacy of Foscarini, provided in his Will, on the eve of the execution for Sarpi's prayers. Sarpi may have rejected the inheritance in the belief of his guilt, or he may have feared for himself and his group.

Jelena Šaulić (1896 – March 21, 1921) was a Montenegrin teacher, participant in the Toplica Uprising, and a Komitadji during World War I.

Jelena Šaulić was born in Junča do near Žabljak, in 1896. She was the youngest of five children in the family of Perko Šaulić, a priest. In record-breaking short time before World War I, she graduated from the school of teacher instruction, and received her appointment as a teacher in Prizren.

In February 1917, Bulgarian forces killed her mother and four days, later the Toplica Uprising started. Šaulić joined the rebels with her father. After the failure of the uprising, she crossed over to Montenegro with her father and the rest of the rebels. There, they joined the group of irregular military, led by Duke Boško Bojović. Šaulić was feared not only by the occupying forces but also by the irregulars who had joined only to loot, whom she mercilessly punished. 

After the war, she married her war companion, Bojović, and started working as a teacher in Pljevlja. She died in Pljevlja, on March 21, 1921, at the age of 26, from the consequences of the wounds sustained in the exhausting battles she took part in. She was posthumously awarded the Karadjordje’s Star with Swords for exceptional bravery. The Association of Warriors and War Veterans or 1912-1918 from Pljevlja, raised a memorial plaque for her at the Pljevlja City Cemetery where she was buried.

James George Semple Lisle

James George Semple Lisle (1759–1815) was a Scottish adventurer and confidence trickster. He used numerous aliases, taking Lisle as a surname additional to his original name, and published in 1799 "The Life of Major J. G. Semple-Lisle", an autobiography, from Tothill Fields Prison.

He was born James George Semple at Irvine, Ayrshire, the son of James Semple, an exciseman and peerage claimant to the title Viscount Lisle. In 1776 he was soldier serving in British North America, was taken prisoner in the American Revolutionary War, then was released and came back to Great Britain.

Semple came to know the novelist Elizabeth Sarah Gooch, with whom he had a brief relationship. Marrying a goddaughter of Elizabeth Pierrepont, Duchess of Kingston-upon-Hull, he accompanied the latter to the continent of Europe. He made autobiographical claims about this period to 1784, involving Frederick the Great during his bloodless campaign of 1778, Catharine of Russia, and Prince Potemkin. He also visited Copenhagen.

Returning to England in 1784, Semple was arrested for obtaining goods by false pretences, and on 2 September 1786 was sentenced to seven years' transportation. Released on condition of leaving England, he went to Paris: he later claimed to have served on General Jean-François Berruyer's staff, and so to have witnessed in the execution of Louis XVI. Back England to avoid arrest, he was again, on 18 February 1795, sentenced to transportation for defrauding tradesmen. In Newgate Prison that year he had dinner with James Boswell, to whom as a lawyer he applied for help with his case.

Unable to obtain a pardon, Semple stabbed himself in Newgate Prison in 1796, when about to be shipped for Botany Bay, and then tried to starve himself to death. He recovered, however, and in 1798 was despatched in the "Lady Jane Shore" transport, bound for Australia. During the voyage a mutiny broke out, Semple's warning of the plot having been disregarded by the captain, Wilcox. Semple, with several others, was allowed to put off in a boat, landed in South America, and, after adventures, reached Tangier, where he gave himself up, and was sent back to England.

Semple was committed to Tothill Fields prison, and at the time of publishing his autobiography in 1799 was still confined there. In 1804 he offered himself to the government, as a spy. In 1807 he was charged with fraud, but was acquitted. In 1814 he was once again sentenced to transportation, in a fraud case for food. Pardoned by the Prince Regent, he undertook to go to Morocco, and died in Lisbon in 1815.

Land Tax Act 1910

The Land Tax Act 1910 and the related Land Tax Assessment Act 1910 were Acts of the Parliament of Australia which imposed a progressive land tax upon the unimproved value of land. The Acts were enacted in November 1910 by the Fisher Labour Government intent on breaking up a number of very large landholdings of under-utilised arable land in Australia that had been secured during the colonial period.

The Land Tax Act’s main provision was a graduated tax on the unimproved value of land that applied to the total value of land owned by absentees and applied to the value of the land minus the first £3,000 for non-absentees. A Commissioner of Land Taxation was appointed to administer the legislation and an office under the direction of the Commissioner was created as a branch of Treasury. The first tax return forms were sent on 10 January 1911, on which landholders had to provide all the information required so they could be assessed for their land tax liabilities. The returns were due back by 1 March 1911, and assessments were sent to taxpayers by 21 April 1911. The tax was payable by the end of June 1911.

The tax was not popular with landowners, but a High Court of Australia challenge to the land tax found the law to be constitutional. Land valuations also brought loud complaints and became the most contentious aspect of the new tax. Landowners filling in their returns had to state the value of their land, but the tax office could reject those valuations. Landowners could object to assessments, and by mid 1913 over 1,800 appeals and objections had been filed. In its first year about 15,000 land tax returns were assessed. In the first three years land tax revenue was around £1.3 to £1.4 million a year.

While the land tax made a contribution to Commonwealth revenue, it was debatable whether it had done much to break up the large estates for closer settlement, and the statistics did not paint a clear picture of what had happened. Some landholders, for example, would reduce their tax liability by splitting their landholdings to relatives, partners or companies to take them below the taxable threshold, and in many cases the cost of the tax was passed on to purchasers or tenants.

The land tax was abolished by the "Land Tax Abolition Act 1953".

Rose Royale

Rose Royale (1954 – 1957) was a French Thoroughbred racehorse. After showing modest form as a juvenile in France she emerged as a top-class performer in the first half of 1957 when she was an unlucky second in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes before winning the 1000 Guineas and finishing third in the Epsom Oaks. In the autumn she added victories in the Prix du Moulin and the Champion Stakes but died at the end of the year.

Rose Royale was a bay filly bred in France by her owner Aga Khan III. During her racing caeer she was trained by Alec Head at Chantilly.

She was sired by Prince Bio, who won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains in 1944 and became a very successful breeding stallion whose other offpring included Sicambre. Rose Royale was the first foal of her dam Rose of Yeroda who won twice a a juvenile in 1950. She was descended from Honora (foaled 1907), a British mare whose other descendants have included Tap On Wood, Jaazeiro and Skip Away.

Rose Royale ran six times as a two-year-old in France in 1956 but failed to win a race.

On her three-year-old debut Rose Royale was sent to England to contest the Princess Elizabeth Stakes over eigt and a half furlongs at Epsom Racecourse and looked a most unlucky loser as she finished second to the Queen's filly Carrozza. On 3 May at Newmarket Racecourse the filly started at odds of 6/1 in a 20-runner field for the 144th running of the 1000 Guineas. Ridden by Charlie Smirke, who had been criticised for his performance at Epsom, she won by two lengths from her stablemate Sensualita with the Irish-trained favourite Angelet in third.

The French jockey Jean Massard took over from Smirke when Rose Royale was stepped up in distance and started 11/10 favourite for the Oaks Stakes at Epsom on 7 June. She appeared ill at ease on the firm ground and finished a well-beaten third behind Carrozza and Silken Glider. The filly took a long time to recover fromthe race and was off the course until September when she finished sixth behind Denisy in the Prix de la Nonette. In the inaugural running of the Prix du Moulin in the following month she was ridden by Roger Poincelet and won from her four-year-old stablemate Chief. Later in October she was back at Newmarket for the ten furlong Champion Stakes and started at odds of 5/2 against opponents including Ballymoss and the Coronation Cup winer Fric. With Massard in the saddle she came home six lengths clear of the Irish outsider No Complaint, with Fric third and Ballymoss unplaced.

Rose Royale was sent to the United States to contest the Washington D C International but ran poorly and finished unplaced behind Mahan. The filly became sick soon after the race and died from an intestinal tumour.

The independent Timeform organisation gave Rose Royale a rating 129 in 1957.

In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Rose Royale a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas.

Lillian Williamson

Lillian Forrester born Lillian Williamson (1879 - ?) was a British suffragette who led an attack on the Manchester Art Gallery.

Williamson was born in 1879. At one point she said she had a degree in History.

In 1911 Williamson was invited to Eagle House near Bath by Linley and Emily Blathwayt. The Blathwayts invited leading suffragettes to visit their house. They created over 40 memorial trees to celebrate these visits in what was known as 'Annie's Arbour'.

Williamson led an attack on the Manchester Art Gallery on 3 April 1913. She, Evelyn Manesta and Annie Briggs waited until the gallery was closing and then proceeded to break the glass on many of the most valuable paintings. The three attacked the glass of thirteen paintings including two by John Everett Millais and two by George Frederick Watts. Staff were alerted by the sound of broken glass and the three were apprehended. Four of the paintings had been damaged by the broken glass. They were bailed to appear before magistrates the next day.

Briggs persuaded the court that she had been present but had not been involved. Evelyn Manesta was given a sentence of a month and Williamson's sentence was three months for malicious damage.

While she was imprisoned she and Manesta were secretly photographed and pictures of them were circulated with pictures of other militant suffragettes to police and art gallery staff. Manesta's photograph was modified to hide that she was being held around the neck whilst the photograph was taken.

Tory power stance

The Tory power stance is a human body position notably adopted by members of the British Conservative Party. The posture consists of standing with the legs spread wide apart, like a heavyweight boxer about to enter the ring. The position has been described colloquially as "the Beyoncé", after the performer Beyoncé. The stance has also been called the "Tory power pose" and "the John Wayne".

The stance appears to have first been used at the 2015 Conservative Party Conference. The stance is believed to be intended to be a display of power and confidence. Politicians pictured in this stance have included Sajid Javid, George Osborne, David Cameron and Theresa May.

Articles in the tabloid press have compared the power stance with poses by characters from "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and "Blackadder".

Jake Wieneke

Jake Wieneke (born September 15, 1994) is an American football wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at South Dakota State and signed with the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2018.

Wieneke attended Maple Grove Senior High School, where he was a three-sport star in football, basketball and track and field. After dealing with injuries for the most part of his junior season, Wieneke established himself as one of the top wide receivers in the state of Minnesota during his senior season. He was a first-team All-State selection and Mr. Football finalist after recording 68 receptions for 1,330 yards and 13 touchdowns. Following his senior campaign, he was invited to play at the Minnesota All-Star Game held in June 2013 and was named the North Offensive MVP after catching two touchdown passes.

After redshirting in 2013, Wieneke was the runner-up for the Jerry Rice Award as the Football Championship Subdivision's top freshman the following year. He garnered second-team Associated Press (AP) All-American status and his first first-team All-Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC) nod after catching 73 passes for 1,404 yards and a school-record 16 touchdowns. Wieneke finished his collegiate career as the Missouri Valley Football Conference career leader in receptions wuth 288, in receiving yards with 5,157 and in receiving touchdowns with 59.

As the 2018 NFL Draft was coming to an end, Wieneke was hoping he would not be selected. With five picks to go, he received a call from the Vikings' wide receivers coach Darrell Hazell asking if he wanted to sign as a free agent with Minnesota if not taken. “So for the last five picks of the draft, I was just kind of hoping that I don’t get drafted and I get to sign with the Vikings,’’ Wieneke said. When the draft ended, Wieneke agreed to terms with the Minnesota Vikings. Wieneke stated: “It’s the best feeling in the world, I get to stay with the team I grew up loving and I get to stay in Minnesota. It can’t be anything better than this.’’

William Hallett Greene

William Hallett Greene (1865?) was the first black member of the U.S. Signal Corps and the first black graduate of City College of New York. 

Greene graduated from City College (now part of the City University of New York) with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1884. The "New York Times" reported on his class' graduation, noting that "W.H. Greene is the first colored boy who has ever graduated from the college, and he has made a good record. The audience applauded him liberally last night." His portrait now hangs in the Trustee Lounge of the City University of New York. 

Greene applied to the U.S. Signal Corps but was initially rejected, as they did not accept any black members at that time. His case was taken up by the then-president of City College, General Alexander Webb, who wrote to Secretary of War Robert Todd Lincoln on behalf of Greene. Lincoln agreed that Greene deserved a place in the Signal Corps but faced strong opposition from Brigadier General William Hazen, Commanding Officer of the Signal Corps. Hazen's opposition rested on the convention (approved by Congress) that black soldiers could only serve in four regiments, two in the cavalry and two in the infantry. After Lincoln overruled Hazen's interpretation of this convention, Greene was accepted into the U.S. Signal Corps as its first African-American member. He had received a high score on the Corps' competitive entrance exam. Greene served in Pensacola, Florida, before being transferred to Rochester, New York. In 1887, only a few years after he enlisted, Greene was dishonorably discharged from the Corps after a series of disputed claims regarding his behavior. He later worked as a janitor and moved to Connecticut with his family.

His enlistment in the Signal Corps in September 1884 opened the door for other African-Americans to enlist in some branches of the Army from which they were previously barred, including the Hospital Corps, Ordnance Corps, Commissary, and Quartermaster Departments.

In 2007, the New York State Assembly's Standing Committee on Veterans’ Affairs paid tribute to Greene's triumphs and challenges with a resolution, "Honoring the Life and Accomplishment of William Hallett Greene, the First Black Graduate of the City University of New York, and Member of the United States Army Signal Corps."

Asaphodes obarata

Asaphodes obarata is a moth in the Geometridae family. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as critically endangered by the Department of Conservation.

This species was first described by Cajetan Felder and Alois Friedrich Rogenhofer in 1875 as "Cidaria obarata". The holotype specimen was collected by Thomas R. Oxley in Nelson and is held at the Natural History Museum in London. Edward Meyrick placed the species within the "Larentia" genus in 1884. In 1898 George Vernon Hudson placed the species within the "Xanthorhoe" genus. In 1971 John S. Dugdale assigned "Xanthorhoe obarata" to the genus "Asaphodes".

Hudson described "A. obarata" as follows:

"A. obarata" is endemic to New Zealand. As well as Nelson, it has been collected in Wellington, Christchurch and at the foot of Mount Hutt. It has also been collected at Waimarino and Ohakune in the North Island as well as Akaroa, Otira, Dunedin, Queenstown and Invercargill in the South Island. 

There has been a contraction of range in Dunedin and Southland and this species is now regarded as being locally extinct in both Dunedin and Invercargill.

Hudson states that this species could be found on the margins of forests and R. W. Fereday communicated that it was a plain-frequenting species that has an affinity for gorse hedges. Hudson also stated that adult moths were on the wing in December and January.

The host plants of this species are unknown.

This moth is classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Critical. It has been hypothesised that this species is under threat as a likely result of habitat loss.

Tacna Province (Chile)

The Tacna Province was a territorial division of Chile that existed between 1884 and 1929, was created on October 31 of 1884, on the basis of of the provinces of Tacna and Arica of the Tacna Department.

It covered from the Sama River to the north, to the Quebrada de Camarones to the south, and from the Andes mountain range to Pacific Ocean. This was under the conditions of Treaty of Ancón, by means of which Chile achieved dominion over the Tarapacá Department, and possession of the provinces of Tacna and Arica for a decade, after which a plebiscite was to be held to determine the region's sovereignty, however there were some problems to carry out the plebiscite. The provisional legal organization will end up working for 50 years until 1929.

In 1885 Chile integrated Tarata to the administration since this country considered that the town was to the east of the Sama river.
In 1925 Chile gave back Tarata because Calvin Coolidge, the President of the United States that was in charge of giving a solution to the issue, said that Tarata was in the west of the Sama river.

In 1929 the Treaty of Lima was signed, Tacna was given to Peru and Arica to Chile, after the treaty, the Arica Departament was moved to the Tarapacá Province and the chilean Tacna Province stopped to exist.

Some of the important persons that lived in Tacna during the Chilean administration is Salvador Allende and his family, they lived eight years in the city. Salvador lived in Tacna since he was a baby, he arrived in 1908 and he studied in the Tacna School (Liceo de Tacna).

The Tacna Province was divided into two departaments:

Next Parliamentary elections will held in Armenia by 2022. They will be the first elections after the 2018 Armenian protests.

The National Assembly has 101 seats, all of which are elected by party-list proportional representation, with seats allocated using the d'Hondt method and an election threshold of 5% for parties and 7% for multi-party alliances.

The ballot paper has two sections; one of which is a closed list of candidates for the party at the national level and the other an open list of candidates for the constituency (of which there are 13) that the voter is voting in. Voters vote for a party at the national level and can also give a preference vote to any of candidates of the same party in a district list. Seats are allocated to parties using the share of the vote at the national level, with half awarded to those in the national list and half to those who receive the most preference votes in the district lists. Four seats are reserved for national minorities (Assyrians, Kurds, Russians and Yazidis), with parties having separate lists for the four groups. A party list can not include over 70% of representatives of the same sex, and any there cannot be four consecutive members of one sex on a nationwide party list.

If a party receives a majority of the vote but gets less than 54% of the seats, they will be awarded additional seats to give them 54% of the total. If a party wins over two-thirds of seats, the losing parties will be given extra seats reducing the share of seats of winning party to two-thirds. If a government is not formed within six days of the preliminary results being released, a run-off round of voting between the top two parties must be held within 28 days. A party winning the run-off will be given the seats required for a 54% majority, with all seats allocated in the first round are preserved.

The following parties and electoral alliances participated in the election:

Lisa Dyson (born 1974) is an American scientist and entrepreneur. She is the CEO of Kiverdi, a biotechnology company that uses natural microbes to transform CO2 and other gases into high-valued oils, nutrients and bio-based products.

Dyson grew up in Southern California. Dyson completed a Bachelors degree in mathematics at Brandeis University in 1997. After meeting several physics professors, she became more interested in Quantum Field Theory. She was a Fulbright Scholar at Imperial College London, where she received a Masters of Science. Dyson earned her PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2004, working with Leonard Susskind and on quantum gravity. Her thesis, "Three lessons in causality : what string theory has to say about naked singularities, time travel and horizon complementarity", used string theory and General Relativity. She was only the fourth black woman to achieve a PhD in theoretical high energy physics. She worked Matthew Kleban on the Boltzmann Brain problem.

After completing her PhD, Dyson joined University of California, Berkeley. Dyson worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University and Princeton. She worked as a consultant at Boston Consulting Group between 2004 and 2006. She has worked with the chemical and energy industry.

In 2008 she founded Kiverdi, a technology company that looks to revolutionise agriculture. Instead of concentrating on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, Kiverdi look to reuse CO into proteins and oils. She came across the concept when reading NASA papers, where astronauts had used hydrogenotrophs to convert carbon dioxide in exhaled breath into nutrient rich crops. She started to grow the microbes in her lab, working with manufacturers to scale-up their technology. They are also interested in alternative fuels and bio-products.

Swedish Infantry Combat School

Swedish Infantry Combat School (, InfSS) was a combat arms school of the Swedish Army which operated in various forms from 1874 to 1995. The school was located at Kvarns bruk north of Borensberg.

The Swedish Infantry Combat School ("Infanteriets stridsskola", InfSS) originated from the Swedish Infantry Gunnery School ("Infanteriskjutskolan", SS) which was formed in 1878 in Stockholm. Although it was the school's official name, it also came to be called the Shooting School for the Infantry and the Cavalry ("Skjutskolan för infanteriet och kavalleriet"). On 1 October 1942, the school was reorganized into the Swedish Infantry Combat School. On 1 June 1953 the Swedish Army ABC-Defence School was added as a training school within the Swedish Infantry Combat School. On 1 February 1961, the school was organizationally transferred to Svea Life Guards (I 1). On 1 October 1961, the school adopted the name "Infanteriets stridsskola" (InfSS), when the school was relocated to Linköping. On 1 April 1963 the Infantry Officer School ("Infanteriofficersskolan", IOS) and the Cavalry Officer School ("Kavalleriofficerskolan", KOS) was amalgamated and came to be a part of the course of the Swedish Infantry Combat School.

Since the school constituted an independent unit of organization within the Swedish defense, it came on 1 July 1991 to organizationally be part of the Swedish Army's Infantry and Cavalry Center ("Arméns infanteri- och kavallericentrum", InfKavC). The Swedish Infantry Combat School was one of three combat arms schools within the Swedish Army's Infantry and Cavalry Center. The other two schools were the Swedish Infantry Officers’ College in Linköping Garrison and the Swedish Infantry and Cavalry Combat School ("Infanteriets och kavalleriets stridsskola", Inf/KavSS) in Umeå Garrison.

On 30 June 1995, the three combat arms centers Swedish Army's Infantry and Cavalry Center and the Swedish Army Armoured Center ("Arméns pansarcentrum", PaC), were dissolved in order to form a joint combat arms center on 1 July 1995; the Swedish Army Brigade Center ("Arméns brigadcentrum", BrigC). Through this reorganization, on 1 July 1995 three new joint army schools were formed, Combat School North ("Stridsskola Nord", SSN), Combat School Middle ("Stridsskola Mitt", SSM) and Combat School South ("Stridsskola Syd", SSS). There the Swedish Infantry Combat School with the Swedish Infantry Officers’ College formed the Combat School Middle.

When the Swedish Infantry Gunnery School was organized in 1878, it came to be placed at Rosersberg Palace. At Rosersberg, the school was located until 1961. When the school was relocated temporarily to Linköping Garrison on 19 May 1961, a ceremony was held at Rosersberg, and on 1 July 1961 the area was handed over to Swedish Civil Defence Board. From 1 September 1961, the school officially operated in Linköping, where it was co-located with the Life Grenadier Regiment (I 4) and located to barracks 2. On 15 May 1963, parts of the school were moved to Kvarns bruk, where the whole school was located in 1966. The facility in Kvarns bruk was taken over by the Combat School Middle

Kyokutaisei Takuya

, is a sumo wrestler from Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan. His debut in "maezumō" was in January 2008, and his first "makuuchi" division "honbasho" was the Natsu tournament in May 2018. His highest rank has been "maegashira" 15.

He was originally a judo practitioner, but was egged on by his father and sponsors from his hometown of Asahikawa to join sumo which he initially rejected. When asked again by his father after he finished high school, he agreed. He was then accepted to Ōshima stable by Ōshima-"oyakata". He was light entering sumo at 83 kg so to add weight he would eat as much and as often as he could even waking up in the middle of the night for snacks to add on the calories. Because of him being so light his oyakata would tell him to imitate Ama later known as Harumafuji who also was a light wrestler. Early on he disliked sumo citing homesickness and the hard life style, he even ran away in the middle of the night to live with one of his friends to get away from sumo. This didn't last long though as he was talked into going back to the stable in time for the next tournament. He was the star of a French documentary, "Tu Seras Sumo," or "," released in 2013, which covered the first nine months of his sumo career in 2008. In July 2014 he made the "sekitori" ranks for the first time when he was promoted to the "jūryō" division, but he was demoted back to "makushita" after only two tournaments. He returned to "jūryō" in September 2015.

His first "makuuchi" division "honbasho" was the Natsu tournament in May 2018 which he debuted at "maegashira" 15.

Kyokutaisei is unusual in that he prefers a "maemitsu" grip on his opponent's "mawashi" or belt – grabbing the front part directly below the stomach area. He is also fond of "dashinage" techniques, which involve throwing the opponent in a pulling motion. His most common winning "kimarite" is "oshi-dashi", or push out.

Kenneth Cross (physiologist)

Sir Kenneth William Cross MRCS LRCP, FRCP (born 26 March 1916 in London, died 10 October 1990) was a British physiologist who was principally known for his fundamental contributions to the physiology of newborns that were so relevant to paediatric practice at the time. 

Kenneth Cross was educated at St Paul's School, London from 1930 to 1935 and then at St Mary's Hospital, London where he won a Moran Scholarship that is a Rugby Scholarship, that was established by Lord Moran Charles Wilson, 1st Baron Moran as a way of picking up the best students for medicine. Cross passed the membership examination of the College within two years of his qualification, in 1940. After several junior house appointments at the beginning of World War II, Cross served in the emergency medical service. Although considered combative by nature, Cross was a self confessed pacifist by conviction, and even though he spent time with the Friends' Ambulance Unit in China during World War II, Cross rarely spoke about the work. 

Cross was married twice. His first wife Joyce Wilson née Lack, was a depressive, who eventually committed suicide in 1970. Cross was also a depressive himself. Cross usually managed to convert his depression into "high spirits" which was evidenced by his work collegues, but this resulted in facing many many long hours of "gloom and despondency" only made bearable by his second wife, whom he had a nuturing and fufilling marriage.

After returning from China, Cross abandoned a potential career as a physician to become a physiologist working in physiology department at St Mary's Hospital. In 1948, he started on researching foetal and neonatal physiology for the ventilation of the newborn baby and was one of the first to apply physiological technique, learned through the research, to the problem of resuscitating newborn babies. Through this work he became a leading member of a group of physiologists, paediatricians and veterinarians who founded the Neonatal Society in 1959. Cross's life work became neonatal research.

Cross was promoted to the academic rank of reader in 1952. Cross spent a year in America in 1958-1959 at the Cardiovascular Research Institute located in the University of California, San Francisco. Working with Julius H. Comroe Jr. Cross helped organize and establish the study neonatal research that later grew into one of the largest paediatric research groups in America. Upon returning from the USA, Cross moved to London Hospital Medical College with a promotion to Professor of Physiology in 1960, a post he held until 1981.

In 1963 he became an honorary director of an Medical Research Council group on the respiration and energy metabolism in the newborn. During 1973, he organized the Joseph Barcroft Centenary meeting for the The Physiological Society. In 1974 he gave the Bertram Louis Abrahams lecture called "Investigating the newborn: the ethical imperative"

On 28 March 1979 Cross was awarded the James Spence Medal, named after Professor Sir James Calvert Spence, and is the highest award of the British Paediatric Association.

Joan Adeney Easdale

Joan Adeney Easdale (23 January 1913 – 10 June 1998) was an English poet from Sevenoaks, Kent, whose father, Robert Carse Easdalem left her mother, Gladys Ellen Easdale née Adeney, during the First World War.

In January 1930, Easdale sent what Virginia Woolf called "piles of dirty copy books written in a scrawl without any spelling, but I was taken aback to find, as I thought, some real merit... it may be a kind of infantile phosphorescence... Very odd." The Woolfs nevertheless took up publishing her books, despite opposition from John Lehmann.

"A Collection of Poems" (1931) appeared as No. 19 in the series "Hogarth Living Poets". It delves into love, sadness, broken relationships and family life. Hugh Walpole described her work as "astonishingly adroit, acute, accomplished". The title poem of her second book, "Clemence and Clare" (1932), addresses Woolf herself. This slim volume too appeared in the "Hogarth Living Poets" series, as No. 23.

In July 1931 Easdale recited some of her work to an accompaniment of piano music composed and played by her brother Brian Easdale. He had studied at the Royal College of Music, written his first opera at the age of 17, and was assisted by his friend Benjamin Britten. He also introduced his sister to Naomi Mitchison. He was to write the music for the Oscar-winning film classic "The Red Shoes" (1948). Easdale herself later worked in London and published in the periodical "The Adelphi". She was married in 1938 to the geneticist James Meadows Rendel, who was related to the Strachey family. Her "Amber Innocent" (1939) was a verse narrative told in symbols. She bore a first child in 1940.

After moving to Australia with her geneticist husband, she began to suffer from severe paranoia and returned, leaving her three children, aged 13, 10 and 6, behind. She lived latterly in Nottingham where she was intermittently visited by her children and grandchildren.

Stand Down Order (1947)

The Stand Down Order was the title of a general order issued by Field Marshall Claude Auchinleck, the Supreme Commander of the Indian and Pakistani military forces, in 1947. It directed that, in the event of a war between the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan, all the British officers on both sides should immediately stand down. The order was never invoked. However, it was raised when the Pakistani Governor General, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, ordered Pakistani Army to march into Kashmir following the Indian air lift of troops for its defence. At Auchinleck's instance, Jinnah was forced to rescind his order. In subsequent months, the British government watered down the strength of the order, and Genreal Douglas Gracey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistani Army, defied it. Three brigades of the Pakistani Army were fighting in Kashmir in May 1948, as reported by Pakistan's foreign minister, Sir Zafrullah Khan, to the United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan.

Criticisms of medicine

Despite the tremendous progress of medical science in raising general health levels and increasing life expectancy, there has been criticism that deficiencies retard further advances in public health and contribute to the increased commercial success and popular appeal of alternative healing modalities that are not based on science and in some cases can be very harmful.

The claimed failures of modern medicine include lack of time and effort devoted to the patient-doctor relationship, methodological flaws in published research, inadequate access to heath care among the poor, and frequent high-profile scandals involving malpractice or scientific fraud. Certain problems, such as excessive cost of treatment and over-prescription of opioids and other pharmaceuticals, are particularly acute in the United States. The history of medicine has been characterized by patterns of discrimination and abuse against women and minorities; and despite improvements, the job of providing healthcare equitably without bias is still a work in progress.

In developing countries and in wealthy countries such as the United States that have no 
universal health insurance, the less affluent sections of the population often have inadequate access to modern medicine. Some developing countries, such as Cuba, have had success in providing universal healthcare, although in the case of Cuba hospitals have been plagued by shortages caused by the U.S. embargo.

In the U.S., a country without universal health insurance, the access problem is aggravated by spiraling costs. Costs of a hospital procedure often vary wildly from one region of the U.S. to another, and even among hospitals in the same region. The pharmaceutical industry, in particular, has been accused of price-gouging.

Although the United Nations recognizes healthcare as a fundamental human right, no such right is recognized in the U.S. Americans have many fundamental rights, including the right to own private property and the right to bear arms (which, in the view of many Americans, includes the right to own an assault rifle), but healthcare is not on the list. Even President Franklin Roosevelt's famous Four Freedoms speech in 1941, which was an attempt to broaden the concept of rights for Americans, did not include healthcare as a right.

In a paper published in 2010, Edzard Ernst, a leading authority on "complementary and alternative medicine" (CAM), discusses the appeal
of CAM:

[CAM] is popular. An analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor. Providers of CAM tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals. In turn, this implies that much of the popularity of CAM is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare. We should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients.

Similarly, David H. Freedman has said that an explanation for the appeal and commercial success of CAM in the United States is "its adherence to a 'healing' model of patient care" -- a model that is too time-consuming and inefficient for most physicians working under the constraints of the standard American health care system.

Stanford University School of Medicine Professor John Ioannidis has sharply criticized the quality of published medical research, claiming that most published findings are false. Marcia Angell of the Harvard Medical School has written: 

In a two-part article in "The New York Review of Books", Angell was sharply critical of the pharmaceutical industry, medical researchers, and psychiatrists for promoting the over-use of psychotropic drugs in the U.S. She wrote that unfavorable studies on the use of such drugs had been suppressed and only the more favorable studies had been made available to the public and to regulators. She further wrote that there is evidence that some psychotropic pharmaceuticals can cause brain damage, especially in children.

Some writers have criticized Ioannidis' own methodology and maintained that his conclusions are greatly exaggerated. In this debate about the prevalence of faulty methodology in medical research, the objective of both sides is to improve the reliability of science-based medicine, not to support alternatives to it; Marcia Angell, for example, is an outspoken opponent of CAM. 

The U.S. is experiencing what some call an "opioid epidemic," and opioid overdose is a significant cause of death in many American cities. This crisis has been caused both by over-prescription of opioids and by illegal traffic in the drugs.

Writers have pointed to a widespread desire among the public to find a pill for any problem,
even if a better solution might be a lifestyle change, such as exercise, improved diet, and stress reduction.

Major malpractice or scientific fraud scandals can also undermine public confidence in mainstream medicine. For example, in the early 1990s the Imanishi-Kari case and the Luk van Parijs case of research misconduct led to the resignation of Nobel Prize-winner David Baltimore as President of Rockefeller University and as President of the California Institute of Technology, respectively. In 1998 the British medical researcher Andrew Wakefield wrote a paper, published in "The Lancet", in which he claimed that he had established a link between autism and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. His widely publicized paper gave encouragement to the anti-vaccine movement, but it turned out to be fraudulent. In 2016 at the world-renowned Karolinska Institute, the Paolo Macchiarini affair, involving multiple deaths from malpractice, led to the resignation of the Secretary of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine, the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor of the Karolinska Institute, and the dismissal of the entire board of the Institute.

In the U.S., one consequence of the professionalization of medicine early in the 20th century -- culminating in the Flexner report in 1910 -- was the decreasing role of midwives. Although the main purpose of the Flexner reforms was to standardize and improve medical training, some historians have written that another purpose was to combat the "irregulars," such as homeopaths and midwives. This not only reduced the opportunities for women and minorities as health care providers, but also sometimes resulted in setbacks for women's health. In 1936 the prominent gynecologist-obstetrician Frederick J. Taussig wrote that the "therapeutic" (legal) abortions performed by doctors at the time were more dangerous -- more likely to result in often fatal perforations -- than the (illegal) abortions that had been performed in earlier decades by midwives. 

The clinical trials leading to approval of the early birth-control pills have been criticized as inadequate and for greatly underestimating the serious side-effects, and the disastrous consequences of the heavily-marketed Dalkon Shield caused further questioning of the medical establishment's commitment to women's health and safety.

A related criticism is that for a long time, and occasionally even in the 21st century, clinical studies have routinely excluded women, and medical researchers have made the unfounded assumption that conclusions from those studies relating to safety, effectiveness, and appropriate dosages would apply in exactly the same way to women as to men.

Historians of medicine have written that in the U.S. some of the founders of the field of gynecology in the 19th century used African American and poor immigrant women as guinea pigs for experimental surgery; and that African American men were also abused by medical researchers, for example, in the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment conducted between 1932 and 1972.

<doc id="57287219" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57287219" title="Anna Morozova">
Anna Morozova

Anna Morozova (; 23 May 1921 – 31 December 1944) was a Soviet partisan who later joined the Red Army and became a posthumous recipient of the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 8 May 1965 for her resistance activities.

Morozova was born on 23 May 1921 to a Russian peasant family in Polyana village within the Kaluga Governorate. She moved in 1936 to Bryansk when her father got a job as manager of a tailor shop. After graduating from eight grades of secondary school she studied to become an accountant. In 1938 she was hired to work as a telephone operator until her job was no longer needed. In November 1939 she worked at a tailor's shop until she began working for the Soviet Air Force.

Not long after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Morozova's home city of Seshcha was taken over by the German military on 9 August. After the Germans took over the airfield where she worked they ousted the 9th Heavy Bomber Aviation Brigade of the Soviet Air Forces from the field and parked an estimated 300 German bombers of the "Luftflotte" 2 at their new airbase. The German occupiers used the airbase during their bombings of Moscow and other major cities. The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Soviet Union was in desperate need of information about the state of the strategically important airbase that had been taken over by the Luftwaffe. To gain such intelligence for the Red Army, an underground reconnaissance organization was created by resistance members in Bryansk to infiltrate the airbase. Morozova returned to Seshcha to work undercover at the airbase as a laundress, where she ended up meeting several of her friends from school that were unable to leave the city in time. She invited them to join her partisan group; from Spring 1942 to September 1943 they operated as part of the 1st Kletnyanskaya Partisan Brigade, spying in enemy forces, sabotaging and outright destroying Luftwaffe aircraft, and disabling ground equipment. The brigade eventually became an international resistance organization, spanning the Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia. When the unit got their hands on magnetic landmines they used them to destroy twenty aircraft, six trains, and two ammunition warehouses. The unit transferred information on the specifications of Tiger tanks, identification papers of German soldiers, and medical technology. The information Morozova provided to the Air Force made sure that Soviet bombers attacked the correct airbase where the Germans were stationed instead of a dummy base constructed by the Germans. Later other partisans used the information she gathered to storm the airbase, killing an estimated 200 German airmen and 30 cars. 

In September 1943 Morozova left the partisan movement and joined the Red Army after Soviet forces retook control of Seshcha in the operation to retake Bryansk. She was awarded the Medal "For Courage" and the Order of the Red Star by the 10th Army of the Soviet Union for her activities in the partisan movement. After joining the Red Army and graduating from radio operator's courses in July 1944 she was deployed to Poland as part of the 10th Army in Poland, using the pseudonym "Swan". In late 1944 she was assigned to a Soviet-Polish partisan unit. On 31 December 1944 after she was badly wounded in battle when a bullet shattered her wrist she detonated a grenade on herself in order to avoid capture, ending her life and killing two SS soldiers. 

Morozova's image was featured on a 1966 postage stamp of the Soviet Union and a postal cover of the Russian Federation. Multiple streets in Bryansk bear her name and she was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union in 1965.

In April 1997 the company Sheriff became the team's general sponsor giving the club its current name. FC Sheriff were champions of the "A" Division at the first attempt, achieving successive titles and promotion to the Moldovan National Division. They were not as successful in the Moldovan Cup as they were eliminated in the first round.

FC Sheriff finished fourth in their first National Division season which is currently their lowest top-flight finish. They won the 1999 cup final, by doing so Sheriff qualified for the 1999–2000 qualifying round for the UEFA Cup. FC Sheriff's first European opponents were Czech side SK Sigma Olomouc, a 1–1 draw at home and 0–0 away meant Sigma Olomouc progressed on the away goals rule. Sheriff finished the 1999–2000 season as runners-up in the league and quarter-finalist in the cup. The 2000–01 season was the beginning of FC Sheriff's dominance of the National Division, they won both the league and the cup to achieve their first double. FC Sheriff won the National Division championship in the next nine seasons, winning the 2006–07 season undefeated. During the nine seasons they also won the cup five times and qualified for the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League each season.

The 2010–11 Moldovan National Division was won by FC Dacia Chișinău with Sheriff finishing in second place and qualifying for the Europa League qualifying phase. FC Sheriff won the next three league titles with no cup wins. FC Sheriff finished the 2014–15 Moldovan National Division in third place behind Milsami Orhei and Dacia Chișinău but won the cup thus still qualifying for the Europa League qualifying rounds. FC Sheriff resumed their dominance with three more league titles and a cup win.

The Moldovan Super Cup, a match between the winners of the National Division and the winners of the Moldovan Cup, was introduced in the 2003–04 season and is played at the beginning of each season. If one team has won both competitions it is not played, this has happened in four seasons and each time it is FC Sheriff who has won the double. Of the ten Super Cups played, FC Sheriff have won seven, been runners-up twice and did not qualify for the 2011 edition.

Roosevelt Jones (born January 25, 1993) is an American professional basketball player for the Canton Charge of the NBA Gatorade League. He played college basketball for Butler.

Jones attended O'Fallon Township High School. He led O'Fallon to the semifinals of Illinois' Class 4A state tournament in 2010. He was a three-star recruit ranked in the 2011 Rivals 150 and the 33rd best freshman small forward in his class. Assistant coach Terry Johnson recruited Jones to Butler, but he didn't realize Jones's poor shooting style due to his athleticism.

Jones averaged 7.8 points and a team high 6.0 rebounds per game as a freshman. On January 22, 2013, he was named Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week after contributing 20 points, five rebounds, four assists, one block and one steal in a 64-63 upset over No. 8 Gonzaga for College GameDay in a game in which leading scorer Rotnei Clarke was sidelined. Jones stole the ball at midcourt with ten seconds to go and hit a ten foot floater at the buzzer for the win. Jones was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Defensive Team as a sophomore. He averaged 10.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game and led the team in assists, with 3.5 per game on a 27-9 team.

On August 16, it was announced that Jones tore ligaments in his left wrist during a preseason trip to Australia and needed to undergo surgery that would force him to miss the entire season. He travelled with the team most of the year but missed the conference tournament as his Butler teammates struggled to a 14-17 season. In June, he was medically cleared to practice again. Coming into his redshirt junior year, Jones was a preseason All-Big East Honorable Mention. As a junior, he averaged 12.7 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game. He was named to the All-Big East Second Team. Jones had 23 points in Butler's 67-64 loss to Notre Dame in the NCAA Tournament despite playing with a strained knee. 

Jones was a preseason All-Big East First Team selection as a senior. He earned a spot on the Puerto Rico Tip-Off All-Tournament Team. Jones was Big East Player of the Week for the week of December 19 after leading the Bulldogs to a 74-68 victory over ninth-ranked Purdue by tallying 19 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. Jones scored 20 points in a 60-55 loss to Villanova on January 9, 2016 despite spraining his wrist in practice before the game. He hit his only three-pointer on January 30, a half court heave before halftime in a game versus Marquette. On February 6, Jones recorded the first triple-double by a Butler player since 1984 with 10 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists in a blowout victory over St. John's. As a result, he was named CBS Sports National Player of the Week. As a senior, Jones was selected to the All-Big East Second Team. He averaged 13.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game. His 1,533 career points is twelfth highest in Butler history.

Jones was selected by the Canton Charge 19th overall in the 2016 NBA D-League Draft. He started 35 games in his rookie year with the Charge and averaged 6.6 points, 6.4 rebounds and 3.1 assists per game. However, in August 2017 he announced his retirement from basketball due to "unbearable" back pain. On November 6, Jones was charged with drunken driving and resisting arrest as his blood alcohol level was measured at .185. He came out of retirement in January 2018 and rejoined the Charge. Jones missed a game against the Erie BayHawks due to an undisclosed injury in February. He averaged 4.3 points and 7.6 rebounds per game in his second season.

Christ Church, Turnham Green

Christ Church, Turnham Green is a Grade II listed Anglican church sited on the eastern half of Turnham Green in Chiswick, west London. The church and the green on which it sits are local landmarks, and are considered of special historic interest by the London Borough of Hounslow.
Christ Church was commissioned in 1841 to serve the growing population of the suburb of Turnham Green who found it inconvenient to walk to St Nicholas Church by the River Thames. The building cost £6,900; the Church Building Commissioners contributed £500 under the Church Building Act 1818, and therefore Christ Church is deemed a Commissioners' church.

A re-ordering took place in the early 1990s, during which the pews were removed and replaced with discrete chairs, and the floor concreted and carpeted. In 2000 the west bays were converted, under the supervision of architect Ian Goldsmith, into two-storey community rooms.
The church was designed in the Gothic revival style by Sir George Gilbert Scott and his partner William Moffatt; construction was completed in 1843. In 1887 the chancel was extended and given the current square eastern end under architect James Brooks.

The design of Christ Church was praised in the 1841 edition of the journal "The Ecclesiologist", which stated that the tower and spire were "peculiarly excellent, and worthy of any ancient architect".

Cape Araxos

Cape Araxos (also known as Cape Pappas) (), is a cape in the northwest of the Peloponnese in Greece. It is the northwesternmost point of Peloponnese and separates the Gulf of Patras from the Ionian Sea. It lies at a distance of 30 Km west of the city of Patras and very close to the village of Akrotirio Araxou. In 1877 a stone lighthouse was built but it was destroyed during the second world war and a modern lighthouse was installed after some years. The waters in the area are dangerous because of the continuous additions of sediments eroding from the uplands of Aetolia-Acarnania via the rivers Acheloos and Evinos so making the waters quite shallow in some parts. 

During the World War II, the area close to the cape was a naval minefield and there were many losses of ships and human lifes. On 29 May 1945 the Dutch cargo ship "Mars" fell into a mine and was sunk. Today it is one of the most nicely preserved shipwrecks of the Gulf of Patras. 

The land around the cape belongs to the Greek Navy which operates a small naval base (Araxos Naval Fort) so the access to the area is restricted same like the navigation without permission closer to a distance of 450 m from the coast.The base hosts the Naval Radio Transmitter Facility of Araxos (Κέντρο Εκπομπής Αράξου).
According to Hellenic Coast Guard in the area operates the "cape Pappas RSS" (Remote Site Sensor) which is a remotely controlled sensor and radar facility of the national Vessel traffic service system of Greece (Officialy called Vessel Traffic Management and Information System).

According to Benčina, he enjoys acting in plays because the audience changes every night, "Although you play the same show, every night is another audience and it's different, so there is some specificity related to the theater."

He is married to Serbian actress Tamara Dragicevic and they have a daughter together. He and his wife are a popular celebrity couple in Serbia. His brother, Igor Benčina, is also an actor, seen in the Serbian film "Teret" (Cargo) which was screened at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as the Serbian thriller ""The Last Panthers"", a television show popular with former British Prime Minister David Cameron.

Leon Lang

Leon S. Lang (c. 1899-1956) was ordained as a rabbi by the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1927. Lang served as the inaugural editor of the quarterly journal Conservative Judaism published by the Rabbinical Assembly. Lang also served a term as the President of the Rabbinical Assembly coinciding with 1941. Lang "was internationally known as chairman of the Chaplaincy Availability board of the Rabbinical Assembly of America" as he collaborated with the U.S. Defense department in recruiting military chaplains and also represented the Jewish Welfare Board to the American armed forces.

The history of Congregation Sons of Israel in Nyack, NY indicates that Lang began to serve as the congregation's full-time rabbi in 1925, two years prior to the recorded date of his ordination, and Lang declared the congregation as committed to "Traditional Judaism," somewhere between Reform and Orthodoxy--a stance that would change later as the congregation joined the United Synagogue of America, eventually renamed the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. The official history of Oheb Shalom Congregation in Newark, NJ (now relocated to South Orange, NJ) states that Lang began to serve the community as its Assistant Rabbi in 1927 (serving alongside the Senior Rabbi, Charles I. Hoffman) and continued in his position for 12 years. During this tenure, Lang is credited with founding Kadimah (perhaps the very same organization now known today as Kadima, the subsidiary of United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism) and developing youth programming and reinvigorating the community's Men's Club. By 1932, Lang was recalled as having served in recent history as a President of National Young Judea.

Lucius Banks

Lucius Banks, who played for Hunslet R.L.F.C. in Hunslet, Leeds in 1912, is thought to be the first black athlete to compete in rugby league football; the first American to play rugby league; and, according to the historian Tony Collins, 'probably only the fourth black American to play professional football of any code'.

Little is recorded in scholarship on Bank's life apart from his time playing rugby in the UK. Prior to coming in the UK, Banks had served in the US cavalry, probably being the Lucius Banks recorded as a private in 1910 in the "Army and Navy Register".

Banks was spotted playing as a quarterback in New York by a one-time member of Hunslet R.L.F.C.'s management committee, and the club bought him out of the army and brought him to the UK, apparently partly because the club thought an exotic player would boost revenue. The strategy seems to have worked, as 'his presence significantly swelled the attendance at his first game'.

Banks's performance seems to have been fairly successful: playing on the wing, he scored four tries during his first four games for the club, the first of which was on 27 January 1912, against York R.L.F.C.. He later moved to playing as stand off half, before returning to America following his last game with the club, on 26 December 1912.

It may be that it was the same Lucius Banks who worked as a policeman in Boston from at least 1919 into the 1930s.

Local news reporting on Banks's first game in England included some prominent racist coverage, with a local evening paper running the headline 'Hunslet's Coloured Coon' and the "Yorkshire Post" suggesting that local players should have been hired instead and commenting that 'if the club wanted to sign "coloured" players they should go to South Africa, where "they are reputed to be capable goal kickers with bare feet" '.

More recently, however, Banks has become a celebrated figure, seen as a pioneer in what has become a long history of black rugby league players.

Governorate of New León

New León Governorate or Magellanic Lands (1529−?) was one of the colonial governorates of the Spanish Empire, located in southern South America.

The governorate was created as one of King Charles V's grants of 1529, establishing the "adelantado" Simón de Alcazaba y Sotomayor as its first governor, captain general, and chief justice. The territory was described as extending 200 leagues down the Pacific coast from Pedro de Mendoza's grant of New Andalusia.

On May 21, 1534 the king signed three other capitulations to explore and occupy the American lands, establishing provinces or governorates of 200 leagues of north-south extension, including the governorship of Nueva León, granted to Simón de Alcazaba and Sotomayor, also from Atlantic Ocean to Pacific, south of 36° 57' 09S (line from Coronel to Pinamar) and up to 48° 22' 52s (line from Campana Island to Laura Bay).

The Governorate was subsequently extended to the Strait of Magellan and the southern lands from it.

Wa Shi (1498–1560), was a Zhuang noblewoman, who was a warrior, general, and political figure in southern China in the latter years of the Ming Dynasty, who is best known for countering the "wokou" pirates along China's southeastern coast during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor.

Wa Shi’s father was nobleman Cen Zhang, a powerful lord of the Cen clan. She was a member of the minority Zhuang people from southern China, many of whose women trained as warriors. Her husband was the Zhuang noblemen Cen Meng, a Tusi (or chieftan) with whom she had a son, Cen Bangzuo. In the period 1524-1527 Cen Meng broke with the Chinese ruling dynasty. Because his rebellion endangered all of the Zhuang lords, Wa Shi’s father, Cen Zhang, had Cen Meng poisoned. After Cen Meng’s death, Wa Shi exploited the power vacuum to manoeuvre herself into a position of power, eventually becoming one of the most powerful lords in the Zhuang heartlands. 
Under the Jiajing Emperor, Wa Shi participated in the government of Tianzhou in the Guangxi region of China. In 1553 Wokou pirates intensified their raids on the southeastern coast of China. In 1555, the emperor appointed Wa Shi as regional commander to assist general Yu Dayou in suppressing the pirates. In March 1555 Wa Shi led troops to cross several thousand li (Chinese miles) from Tianzhou to defend Jinshanwei (modern Shanghai), and rescued a Marshal of the Ming Dynasty from an enemy ambush. Wa Shi also had a victory at Shengun (‘Flourishing Mound’) in Suzhou, which was commemorated by changing its name to ‘Victorious Mound’. In 1557 Wa Shi was chosen as a general to act against the Japanese pirates who plaguing the southeast Chinese coast. She lead over 6000 Zhuang infantry against the pirates and successfully defeated them at Wangjiangjing (north of modern Jiaxing). As a consequence, the emperor ennobled Wa Shi and granted her the title of ‘Lady of Premier Rank’ (一品夫人; "yi pin fu ren").

Wa Shi died in 1560 and was buried in the Guangxi region.

Orthoclydon pseudostinaria is a species of moth in the Geometridae family. It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as critically endangered by the Department of Conservation.

This species was first described by George Vernon Hudson in 1918 under the name "Xanthorhoe pseudostinaria". Hudson subsequently placed the species within the genus "Orthoclydon".

Hudson described the species as follows:

"O. pseudostinaria" is endemic to New Zealand. Hudson first collected the species at Otira. The moth was subsequently also found to be present at Gouland Downs near Nelson as well as in the Nelson district, Mount Grey and White Rock in Canterbury.

The plant host of "O. pseudostinaria" is unknown. Given the rarity of the moth species it has been hypothesized that the host plant is also uncommon.

In 1928 Hudson regarded this species as being very rare and this moth is now classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Critical.

Eddy Est Imbattable!

Eddy Est Imbattable! ("Eddy Is Undefeatable!") is a 1971 Belgian French-language song by Pierre-André Gil about Belgian cycling champion Eddy Merckx. It was released on the label "EMI" and had the song "Eddy & Claudine" as B-side, which is also about Merckx. Claudine Aucou is his wife. Earlier in 1969 Gil had recorded another song about Merckx named "Eddy Prend Le Maillot Jaune". 

The song praises Merckx as a great and undefeatable champion. The lyrics mention how the previous Belgian cycling champion Rik van Looy "was great too, but has retired now." Roger De Vlaeminck and Frans Verbeeck are given credit as great champions too, but the singer mentions that nowadays "both of them turn pale when they notice Merckx behind them." 

In 1971 a Dutch language cover of "Eddy Est Imbattable" named "Eddy Is Niet Te Kloppen!" was released, which again had "Eddy & Claudine" as B-side. It was performed by the group Frankie en de Trillers . It was released on the label Monopole .

The 2018 Colorado teachers' strike began on April 27, 2018, with teachers across the state walking out to protest low pay, overcrowded classrooms, and tax cuts that resulted in lower state-wide education spending. The strike was part of the larger wave of teachers' strikes in the United States where protests occurred in West Virginia, Oklahoma and Arizona.

Since at least 2003, teacher salaries after inflation have dropped by 17 percent. The Colorado Education Association stays that the state has underfunded education by $6.6 billion since 2009 by failing to implement a constitutional amendment that requires education funding to grow on pace with inflation. The Colorado Education Association says that teacher salaries after inflation have dropped 17 percent in the last 15 years, and that the state has underfunded education by $6.6 billion since 2009 by failing to implement a constitutional amendment that requires education funding to grow on pace with inflation. 

The strike began on Friday, April 27. On that day, 10 school districts were closed in the state due to the strike.

Two Republican state senators, Bob Gardner and responded by proposing a bill that would fine teachers $5,000 per day for striking and send to teachers to jail for six months for striking. The bill was met with harsh criticism and was killed in subcommittee on April 30.

Benigno Fernández García

Benigno Fernández García was a Puerto Rican politician and attorney at law. 

Fernández García was one of the major players and important political figures of the 20th century in Puerto Rico. He graduated from Georgetown University Law School in Washington, D.C, and practiced as attorney in San Juan, Cayey and Ponce. He was elected Representative from Cayey to the House of Representatives of the Puerto Rico Legislature in 1917 and in 1928 for several terms, while Jose De Diego was Speaker of the House, and he was then the House vice-speaker. His father, Benigno, also founded the Colegio de Abogados de Puerto Rico (Puerto Rico Bar Association) in 1933, and was also at one time Mayor of Cayey from 1924 to 1928, and in 1941 the Secretary of Labor of Puerto Rico, under Governor Rexford Tugwell.

Benigno Fernandez Garcia was appointed as the first Puerto Rican U.S. District Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico in 1934, by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As U.S. District Attorney, he litigated the famous "500 Acre Cases", all the way to the United States Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., in order to regain control of the vast landholding of many major U.S. corporations mostly sugar companies, which monopolized large acres of land in Puerto Rico. These corporations were in violation of the land holding limitations statutes of the Foraker Law, the law that had been enacted by the U.S. Congress to govern Puerto Rico after the Spanish–American War's triumph by the United States, and whereby Puerto Rico was surrendered by Spain as war booty by the Treaty of Versailles. These major corporations blatantly exceeded the allowable holding of 500 acres of land, and repatriated out of Puerto Rico their vast profits, exploiting the poor laborers and the land for decades, and with time they became known as "the absent capital", which Fernandez Garcia legally successfully confronted in the "500 Acre Insular Cases".

The aftermath of the triumphs of Fernandez Garcia's legal battles gave way to the successful land distribution programs of the new Popular Democratic Party, led by Luis Munoz Marin, of which he had also been a founding member together with his son, Lionel. These landmark cases became part of the social justice programs of the Popular Democratic Party, whose goal was to bring justice and progress to the poor and working classes of the island and provided the land regained to the poor, so they could have their "parcelas", the term used to refer to the pieces of land distributed by the government as part of the Popular. Democratic Party Program which promoted Pan, Tierra, Libertad...Bread, Land and Liberty.

Until his death in 1944, Fernandez Garcia was adviser and collaborator to Luis Munoz Marin, who would become the first elected Puerto Rican governor. He dedicated his life to the causes of social justice, to which he was deeply committed-thus the driving force of the Popular Democratic Party, which would rise into power in Puerto Rico by means of the popular vote and democracy, out of the dire straits of poverty to insert the island into the road to growth and progress through the successful implementation of Operation Bootstrap". Years later the island would be known as the "Showcase of the Caribbean."

Gruppe 33

Gruppe 33 (English: Group 33) was an anti-fascist collective of Swiss artists founded in Basel.

“Group 33” was founded on the same day Nazis began burning books en masse, 10 May 1933. It was formed by 15 artists out of a shared political ideology in conjunction with a growing resistance to Nazi influence in the border town of Basel. The members also opposed the dominance of older conservative artists who controlled the Society of Swiss Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (German: "Gesellschaft Schweizerischer Maler, Bildhauer und Architekten", or GSMBA).

The collective was mostly made up of artists and architects from many different disciplines, but also included poets, musicians, actors, and writers. Their work was varied in expression as well as medium, incorporating avant-garde, surrealism, constructivism, and New Objectivity. 

Over the course of several decades, 38 artists came to be associated with Gruppe 33. It continued to serve as a network emerging expressions and artistic movements. The group was officially dissolved in 1970. In 1983, a retrospective of the group’s work was held at the Kunsthalle Basel.

Sock wrestling

Sock wrestling is a game that can be played by children, teenagers and young adults, with at least 3 people (two players and one referee) and consists of taking one or both of your opponent's sock off their foot to win.

There can be an unlimited amount of players, who can or cannot be organized in cooperating teams.

Sock wrestling is often mentioned as a good choice for recreational activity for primary education teachers or physical education classes.

It is recommended that the players are above 8 years old.

The two players must be sitting down or on their knees on the ground before the match starts, without footwear and wearing two socks. It's better to play on top of gym mats or carpeted room. When the referee gives a signal to start (such as shouting "go" after a countdown of three, etc.), the match starts. It is recommended to use old socks, since there is the risk of them being damaged and tore during the game. Excessive force is not allowed.

The players then must struggle to reach the opponent's feet and remove their socks, and be careful to not have their socks removed. The first one to take one or both socks off or the one with most socks (in case of multiple players) wins.

It has a rosette of dull green leaves on side growth at its base and up to fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers with reddish to brownish glands on its labellum. 

"Arthrochilus sabulosus" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber that produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has a rosette of between two and three egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves on side growth at the base of the flowering stem, each leaf long and wide. Between three and fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear but tapered, long, about wide and partly wrapped around the base of the column. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped but curved, long and about wide. The petals are also linear and curved, long and about wide. The lateral sepals and petals are turned back against the ovary. The labellum is green with a dark purplish blotch at its base, about long and wide on a short stalk or "claw". There is an insect-like callus about long with reddish brown, hair-like glands in a central band. The tip of the callus is about wide and brownish with shiny black glands. The column is about , curved, light green with a few purplish spots and has two pairs of curved wings. Flowering occurs from November to July.

"Arthrochilus sabulosus" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected on Horn Island. The description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("sabulosus") is a Latin word meaning "full of sand" or "sandy", referring to the sandy places where this orchid tends to grow.

The spotted elbow orchid grows in sand dunes with scrub vegetation. It is found on the northern part of the Cape York Peninsula and on Horn Island in the Torres Strait.

As with other "Arthrochilus" orchids, "A. sabulosus" is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus "Arthrothynnus" although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

On August 1st 1998 at around 10:30 to 11pm, Christine Mirzayan was walking home in Washington, D.C. when she was dragged into the woods. Mirzayan yelled out and a man responded, asking if she was okay. There was no response from Mirzayan so the man continued on. The next day, she was found raped and murdered by a blow to the head. The police asked for the public's help after the murder and another person who had heard Mirzayan scream during the murder came forward and provided law enforcement with a description of a man who they saw running out of the woods moments after the scream. This description was enough to provide the public with a composite sketch of the suspect.

Ružica Nikolić

Ružica Nikolić (; born 1976) is a politician in Serbia. She has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2017 as a member of the far-right Serbian Radical Party.

Nikolić was born in Belgrade, then part of the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. She is a surdologist (similar to an audiologist) based in her home city.

Nikolić received the 184th position on the Radical Party's electoral list in the 2008 Serbian parliamentary election. The party won seventy-eight seats, and she was not included in its assembly delegation. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Nikolić could have received a mandate despite her relatively low list position, although ultimately this did not occur.)

The Radical Party experienced a serious split in late 2008, when many prominent members joining the breakaway Serbian Progressive Party under the leadership of Tomislav Nikolić and Aleksandar Vučić. Ružica Nikolić remained with the Radicals.

Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. Nikolić received the thirty-ninth position on the Radical Party's list in the 2012 election and the eighty-seventh position in the 2014 election. On both occasions, the party failed to cross the electoral threshold to win representation in the assembly. 

She was promoted to the twenty-fourth position on the party's list for the 2016 election. The party won twenty-two mandates on this occasion, and Nikolić was not immediately elected. She was, however, awarded a mandate on July 19, 2017, as a replacement for Jovo Ostojić, who had recently died. She serves as an opposition member and is a member of the assembly's committee on human and minority rights and gender equality.

Mable Howard

Mable "Mama" Howard (February 3, 1905 - March 29, 1994, Berkeley, California) was a community activist.

Mable Howard moved from Galveston, Texas, to the Bay Area during World War Two to work in the shipyards with her husband Rolly. Mable worked as a ship painter and her husband a longshoreman. While working as a ship painter, Mable helped get women into the union. In doing so, Mable earned the friendship and admiration of the famous labor leader Harry Bridges. By the end of World War II, there were 10 kids in the Howard family, so they bought a four-bedroom house in South Berkeley, a mixed neighborhood. 

In the 1960s, Mable, known around town as "Mama" Howard, fought against a proposed above-ground BART rail system that was to divide her community, in an effort to preserve the quality of life in all of Berkeley. As BART was being mapped, Berkeley passed a bond to require the Richmond line to go underground within the city limits. However, a stipulation allowed the line to continue above ground from the Oakland line past South Berkeley before dropping into the tunnel.

Mama Howard found out about this and spearheaded a lawsuit to stop the above-ground tracks, this “Berlin Wall that would have divided the city,” said Howard. Construction halted for nine months of litigation before BART agreed to move the line underground.

In her honor, a subsidized rental complex for seniors was named the Mable Howard Apartments, located on Alcatraz Avenue.

SS Solstad (1916)

Solstad was a steam cargo ship built in 1916 by the Sunderland Shipbuilding Company of Sunderland for A. F. Klaveness & Co of Kristiania. She was primarily employed as a collier doing tramp trade during her career.

"Solstad" was laid down at Sunderland Ship Building Company shipyard in Sunderland, launched on 18 April 1916 (yard number 289), and after successful completion of sea trials was delivered to her owner in June 1916. On May 13, 1916 a new company (Aktieselskapet Dampskibet "Solstad"), a subsidiary of A. F. Klaveness & Co, with NOK 87,000 starting capital was registered to operate the new vessel.

As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . "Solstad" was assessed at , and 7,000 DWT. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 336 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .

After delivery "Solstad" was immediately chartered to transport coal to Egypt and left Sunderland for her maiden voyage on June 15, 1916 for Alexandria. After discharging her load, the ship left for Baltimore on July 24 and reached it on August 19. The vessel then loaded 5,693 tons of coal and left for Alexandria at the end of August. The vessel conducted one more trip from Baltimore carrying 5,689 tons of coal at the end of October arriving at Alexandria on November 27.

After unloading the vessel continued on to Australia arriving there in January 1917. "Solstad" finished loading 78,685 sacks (approximately 6,497 tons) of wheat in Melbourne on February 2 and left the next day for Europe. The ship coaled at Fremantle on February 14, Colombo on March 6, touched off at Aden on March 21, 1917 before arriving at Port Said on April 1 around 09:10. After taking on 500 tons of coal the ship departed Port Said at approximately 17:30 and was directed by the British authorities to proceed to Livorno to discharge her cargo.

On April 5 1917, at around 12:00 noon, "Solstad" was in an approximate position and under command of Captain August Larsen. The weather was clear with a gentle breeze from the southeast. At 15:25 a white stripe was noticed in the water close to the vessel, and shortly after a torpedo hit the No. 2 hold on the port side. The ship immediately began to list to port, and an order was given to stop the engines. As the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship and lower the lifeboats, a submarine flying a German navy ensign but no identification, approached. The captain was interrogated, and was told his vessel was within the blockade zone. A boarding crew went aboard to retrieve food supplies, tools, maps and navigational instruments, etc. As the time passed by, the ship steadied herself and was still floating. With the exception of No. 2 hold, no other hold or room seemed to have any water present. At about 18:00 the submarine commander ordered "Solstad"'s crew to abandon ship. Since the ship was not sinking, scuttling charges were placed on board and fired. As the charges exploded, the vessel began listing and slowly sunk bow first around 18:25. At the Captain Larsen's request the submarine took the lifeboats in tow at around 18:50 and pulled them towards Greece until 19:55. The crew then continued rowing towards Greece, and on April 6 at about 15:15 they managed to reach land near a small town of Marathos (Marathopoli) on the west coast of Greece. It was later discovered that the German submarine was responsible for the ship's sinking.

Arthrochilus stenophyllus

Arthrochilus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved elbow orchid, is a flowering plant in the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is endemic to Tropical North Queensland. It has a rosette of dull green leaves on side growth at its base and up to fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers with dark red to brownish glands on its labellum. 

"Arthrochilus stenophyllus" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber that produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It has a rosette of between two and five linear to narrow lance-shaped leaves on side growth at the base of the flowering stem, each leaf long, wide and lying flat on the ground. Between three and fifteen pale green, insect-like flowers long are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is linear to spatula-shaped, long, about wide and partly wrapped around the base of the column. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped but curved, long and about wide. The petals are also linear and curved, long and about wide. The lateral sepals and petals are turned back against the ovary. The labellum is green with a dark red blotch at its base, about long and wide on a stalk or "claw" about long. There is an insect-like callus about long with a few reddish to reddish brown, hair-like glands in a central band. The column is about , curved, light green with a few purplish spots and has two pairs of curved wings. Flowering occurs from December to February.

"Arthrochilus stenophyllus" was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones from a specimen collected south of Cardwell. The description was published in "Australian Orchid Research". The specific epithet ("stenophyllus") is derived from the Ancient Greek words "stenos" meaning "narrow" and "phyllon" meaning "leaf", referring to the narrow rosette leaves.

The narrow-leaved elbow orchid grows with sedges and shrubs in sparse "Melaleuca viridiflora" woodland near Cardwell.

As with other "Arthrochilus" orchids, "A. stenophyllus" is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus "Arthrothynnus" although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

Aaron McEneff

Aaron McEneff (born 9 July 1995) is a Northern Irish professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Derry City in the League of Ireland Premier Division.

McEneff was born in Derry and played youth football with Institute and Tottenham Hotspur before starting his professional career with Derry City.

McEneff has been capped at U21, U19, and U17 level with Northern Ireland.

McEneff was born in Derry and grew up in the Cornshell Fields estate in the city. He attended St. Columb's College while playing youth football for Don Boscos and Maiden City Academy. He has two brothers, Nathan and Jordan. Jordan is currently a youth team player at Arsenal.

McEneff began his career at Institute, playing in the NIFL Championship. He had trials with Kilmarnock and Tottenham Hotspur in early 2012 before impressing for the latter in a youth game against Aston Villa and being snapped up on a two-year scholarship deal in May 2012. Tottenham Technical Director at the time, Tim Sherwood, remarked that McEneff reminded him of "a young Roy Keane." His international clearance did not arrive until January 2013 and he was only allowed to begin playing competitive games after this. He progressed well enough to earn a one-year professional deal in summer 2014, although a long-term knee injury that saw him miss four months at the start of the 2014–15 U21 Premier League season stunted his progress. He regained his place in the U21 side, however his contract wasn't renewed and he was released in June 2015.

McEneff went on trial with Nottingham Forest and Sheffield Wednesday before he returned to his hometown club Derry City to sign an 18-month contract under manager Peter Hutton on 30 July 2015. McEneff made his league debut for Derry in a 2-0 home defeat to Dundalk on 14 August 2015. Initially, McEneff found his form was inconsistent as he struggled to mentally deal with the setback of his departure from Tottenham, however his performances improved after a sustained run of games towards the end of 2015. He finished the season with 9 league appearances. He credits moving back to the League of Ireland with helping him to develop as a player and gain experience of playing real football.

After gradually adapting to life at the club, McEneff established himself as a key player for Derry City. 2016 was his first full season in the League of Ireland and he made 29 league appearances scoring six goals. McEneff signed a new two-year contract extension with the club in September 2016. In 2017 he scored 9 goals in 29 league appearances and also appeared in both legs of the Europa League first qualifying round tie against Midtjylland. His form during the season led him to be linked with a move to Dundalk ahead of the 2018 campaign.

McEneff has represented Northern Ireland at U21, U19, and U17 levels. He was a member of the Northern Ireland U19 team which won the 2014 Milk Cup Elite Section, scoring the winning goal against Canada U20. It was reported in August 2016 that McEneff was set to switch allegiance to the Republic of Ireland, however although he has had discussions about his future, no decision has been made and he has put his international career on hold for the time being. Northern Ireland manager Michael O'Neill was critical of the FAI for entering into discussions with McEneff decribing them as "morally poor", however Republic of Ireland U21 boss Noel King responded by clarifying that the initial communication had come from McEneff's Dublin-born father and in the end the discussions did not lead to the paperwork going through.

John D. Norton

John D. Norton (born 1953) is a professor of the history and philosophy of science at the University of Pittsburgh. 

He had originally studied chemical engineering at the University of New South Wales (1971–1974). After working at the Shell Oil Refinery at Clyde, Sydney for two years, he decided to switch fields, beginning doctoral studies in the School of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of New South Wales (1978–1981). His dissertation was titled, "The Historical Foundation of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity." After finishing his dissertation, he worked at the Princeton University Press on the Einstein Papers Project (1982–1983) under the direction of John Stachel. From 1983 until the present, he has been in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Pittsburgh, first as a visiting faculty member, then (from 1997) as a full professor, serving as Chair of the department from 2000–2005. He is currently Director of the Center for Philosophy of Science.

Norton is considered an authority on the science of Einstein and the philosophy of science. He has published on general relativity, special relativity, the relationship between thermodynamics and information processing, quantum physics, and the genesis of scientific theories. He is well-known for his analysis of Einstein's "Zurich Notebook," a small, brown notebook which contains Einstein's private day-to-day calculations during a critical period (1912–1913) in his development of general relativity. The trio of Einstein scholars, John Norton, John Stachel, and John Earman, have sometimes been jokingly referred to as 

A central theme of his work on Einstein, is that Einstein's fundamental contributions to the "old" quantum theory have been largely forgotten because of his well-known criticism of the "new" quantum mechanics and its statistical interpretation. In the field of information science, Norton has criticized the claim by Rolf Landauer and others that schemes exist whereby digital computers can store data in a logically and physically reversible manner that, until the data are erased, represent an apparent violation of the second law of thermodynamics. In the philosophical debate about thought experiments, Norton has taken the position that all thought experiments (without exception) can be reconstructed as straightforward arguments.

1942 Wairarapa earthquakes

Two 1942 Wairarapa earthquakes shook the lower North Island of New Zealand; on 24 June and 2 August. They were large and shallow with the epicentres close together east of Masterton in the Wairarapa region. The June earthquake was sometimes referred to as the Masterton earthquake but both caused damage over a wide area, from Dannevirke, and Eketahuna to Wellington Whanganui and Otaki. There was one death in Wellington, on 24 June. 

The August earthquake can be regarded as an aftershock of the June earthquake. Both earthquakes were preceded by smaller foreshocks. As the second quake was slightly less in magnitude than the first, they were not an earthquake doublet where the second shake is slightly larger . The August earthquake was considerably deeper (40 km, not 12 km), though another source gives the depths as 43 km and 15 km. There was a further large aftershock on 2 December and another in February 1943.

The region had already experienced several large earthquakes, the very large 1855 Wairarapa Earthquake, and the 1934 Pahiatua earthquake in the Northern Wairarapa. 

The 1855 earthquake occurred on the Wairarapa Fault which is part of the North Island Fault System. 

At 11.16 pm a small and sharp but brief earthquake of magnitude 7.2 Ms (Mw 6.9-7.2) shook a wide area in the lower North Island from Eketahuna to Masterton, Featherston and Wellington; and was noticed from Auckland to near Dunedin. The main earthquake was of 7.2 Ms and the epicentre was near Masterton and 12 km deep. The quake lasted for over a minute and had been preceded by a foreshock three hours earlier at 8.15 pm. 

Many buildings in Masterton were damaged. The mayor Thomas Jordan declared a state of emergency and got troops to patrol the town. 

In Wellington twenty thousand chimneys fell, and there was one death in the suburb of Kelburn when a 70-year old retired chemist Hedley Victor Evens (sic) was killed by coal gas from a fractured pipe. Some downtown pediments were damaged, but some had already been removed after the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake. The city engineer K. E .Luke held that damage was less severe as the quake ended swiftly. 

Another shock the area struck on 2nd August at 12.34 am, preceded by a foreshock on the late afternoon of the 1st. This was of magnitude 7.0 Ms (Mw 6.8) or slightly less than the earlier quake. Wairarapa except for Eketahuna did not suffer as badly, though in Masterton the June damage was exacerbated. 
The 2 August aftershock was followed by a third severe aftershock on 2 December, with about 600 aftershocks recorded to the end of the year. 

Repairs from the first quake were not completed, and the mortar for some repairs had not properly set. Some buildings weakened in June suffered further damage, though it was sometimes hard to tell if further damage had occurred. 

In Masterton many buildings were badly damaged by the first quake; the fire station, the Bank of New Zealand, several shops and St Matthews Church (which was later blown up by the Army). The Waiohine road bridge was badly sunken and was closed. After the second quake the Wairarapa Farmers Co-op building partly collapsed. 

In Wellington the first quake toppled some twenty thousand chimneys. In August there was damage in the Willis Street – Manners Street area to three buildings including Charles Begg and the Duke of Edinburgh Hotel. Manners Street between Willis and Cuba Streets was closed for several months.

A Wellington Hospital nurse was lucky to be on night duty as a chimney crashed onto her bed. At Porirua Mental Hospital 800 patients had to be transferred to other hospitals. 

The cost of the damage from these two quakes was more than £2 million (pounds), a considerable amount for a war-straitened economy. In Masterton damage from the two quakes was still apparent some 12 years later. 

Another result was the establishment by the government of the Earthquake Commission in 1945.

Ford Crull

Ford Crull (born June 6, 1954) is an American painter associated with neo-symbolist abstract art. Crull was born in Boston,MA, but lived in Seattle until 1976, after which he moved to Los Angeles to embark on his professional career. While still an art student at the University of Washington, he won many prizes at local arts festivals, and was the youngest ever artist to be invited to show at the Northwest Art Annual. Considered a precocious talent, Crull joined Foster White Gallery, one of Seattle’s premier at galleries where he had several exhibitions before graduating university.

From 1976 to 1983 Crull’s work focused on organic, biomorphic shapes on white backgrounds, a gestational period for the artist that expressed in a pure abstract manner with impasto like surfaces. He joined the Stella Polaris Gallery in 1983, where he met art critic and writer Edward Goldman, and host of KCRW’s “Art Talk.” Goldman championed Crull’s works, which were acquired by corporate art collections, and was also instrumental in Crull’s first significant non-gallery show at the Fischer Museum of Art (then the Fisher Gallery) at the University of Southern California.

In 1983 Crull relocated to New York City, and became a seminal figure in the East Village art scene. He was discovered by Colin de Land, founder of Vox Populi, and the Armory Art Show. Crull had several shows the Vox Populi, a time marked also by commercial success, and national recognition for the artist. Crull’s works were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum, Brooklyn Museum, the National Gallery of Art, and the Dayton Art Institute.

In 1989, Crull was part of the very first showing of American artists in the USSR,"Painting Beyond the Death of Painting” at the Kuznetsky Most Exhibition Hall in Moscow curated by American art critic and historian, Donald Kuspit. This coincided with the time Crull was influenced by the Philosophy of Dualism. Upon his return from Russia, Crull began using steel framing for his paintings, with the edges burned. It was an invention that came to him after seeing the ancient icons in Russia. The new works were titled, “Relic Series”.

Digital world

The phrase digital world is most commonly used to in digital pedagogy when defining the need for digital citizenship, digital fluency, and digital literacy. The digital world is the availability and use of digital tools to communicate on the Internet, digital devices, smart devices and other technologies. 

Humanities and education discussions of the 'digital world' tend to create variations when categorising and defining the mass of mediated technologies and human interactions that are suggested as part of the digital world. The phrase 'digital world' is used loosely as a mass noun with many possible meanings and variations.

In simple terms, it could be informally mentioned as the device given to a toddler as access to the 'digital world'. Or in formal usage, it could be references included in standardization policies for educational improvement (by digital world access) for more children suffering from the digital divide. The One Laptop per Child program is an example of digital world inclusion for children living in poverty and suffering from the digital divide.

The phrase digital world was being used in electrical engineering studies before the creation of the World Wide Web . Originally it was used to describe the prevalence of digital electronic devices as opposed to analogue electronic devices. Articles relating to education in the digital world became more common in the 1990s.

An Evening with Fleetwood Mac

An Evening with Fleetwood Mac is an upcoming concert tour by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. The tour's lineup consists of Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Mike Campbell and Neil Finn. The tour marks the first tour with the band for Campbell and Finn, and the first tour without Lindsey Buckingham since the Another Link in the Chain Tour (1994–1995). The tour is scheduled to begin on October 3, 2018, at the BOK Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the North American leg is scheduled to conclude on April 5, 2019, at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Fleetwood Mac's plans for a worldwide concert tour in 2018 were first revealed by Christine McVie in March 2017, when the tour was initially referred to as a "farewell tour", with plans of having the "Rumours" lineup (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Christine McVie, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie) reuniting for another tour for the first time since On with the Show (2014–2015). "The 2018 tour is supposed to be a farewell tour, but you take farewell tours one at a time. Somehow we always come together, this unit. We can feel it ourselves" said McVie. McVie told "The One Show" in June 2017 that the band planned to begin rehearsing in March 2018 and begin the global tour in June.

The band announced the tour on April 25, 2018, with a leg of 52 concerts across North America, beginning in October 2018. Weeks prior to the tour announcement, the band had announced its separation with longtime vocalist and lead guitarist Lindsey Buckingham. The separation was reportedly due to disagreements concerning the tour. According to Stevie Nicks, the band wanted to begin rehearsals in June 2018 and tour at the end of the year, while Buckingham wanted to put off rehearsals until November 2019. Vocalist Neil Finn and guitarist Mike Campbell joined the band after Buckingham's departure.

Military Corps of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta

The Military Corps of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta is the army of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. The air force was active from 1947-1950.

The Order states that it was the hospitaller role that enabled the Order to survive the end of the crusading era; nonetheless, it retains its military title and traditions.

On 26 March 1876, the Association of the Italian Knights of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta ("Associazione dei cavalieri italiani del sovrano militare ordine di Malta", ACISMOM) reformed the Order's military to a modern military unit of the era. This unit provided medical support to the Italian Army and on 9 April 1909 the military corps officially became a special auxiliary volunteer corps of the Italian Army under the name "Corpo Militare dell'Esercito dell'ACISMOM"(Army Military Corps of the ACISMOM), wearing Italian uniforms. Since then the Military Corps have operated with the Italian Army both in wartime and peacetime in medical or paramedical military functions, and in ceremonial functions for the Order, such as standing guard around the coffins of high officers of the Order before and during funeral rites.

In 1947, after the post-World War II peace treaty forbade Italy to own or operate bomber aircraft and only operate a limited number of transport aircraft, the Italian Air Force opted to transfer some of its Savoia-Marchetti SM.82 aircraft to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, pending the definition of their exact status (the SM.82 were properly long range transport aircraft that could be adapted for bombing missions). These aircraft were operated by Italian Air Force personnel temporarily flying for the Order, carried the Order's roundels on the fuselage and Italian ones on the wings, and were used mainly for standard Italian Air Force training and transport missions but also for some humanitarian tasks proper of the Order of Malta (like the transport of sick pilgrims to the Lourdes sanctuary). In the early '50s, when the strictures of the peace treaty had been much relaxed by the Allied authorities, the aircraft returned under full control of the Italian Air Force. One of the aircraft transferred to the Order of Malta, still with the Order's fuselage roundels, is preserved in the Italian Air Force Museum.
The Military Corps has become known in mainland Europe for its operation of hospital trains, a service which was carried out intensively during both World Wars. The Military Corps still operate a modern 28-car hospital train with 192 hospital beds, serviced by a medical staff of 38 medics and paramedics provided by the Order and a technical staff provided by the Italian Army Railway Engineers Regiment.

Ford Focus Active

The Ford Focus Active is a car that is expected to be imported into the United States in the 2020 model year. In 2018 Ford announced that this car and the Ford Mustang would be the only cars sold by Ford in the United States; all other Ford cars in the United States would be discontinued.

It is planned that the Ford Focus Active will be assembled in China as a joint venture with a mainland Chinese company.

As of April of 2018, the Focus Active is supposed to be a five door hatchback that also has characterisics of a crossover, at least visually. The expectation is that it will be imported from China by mid 2019 so that it can be offered with the rest of the 2020 model year cars.

Background

On April 25, 2018, Ford Motor Company announced that it would be making some significant changes to its offerings in North America as part of a larger effort to save money and with the added hope of making themselves more competitive. This plan involves no longer selling any cars except for the Mustang and a compact Focus crossover. This plan will be put into effect over the next four years and will include the U.S., Candada, and Mexico. This decision was based on the declining demand for cars in favor of trucks and SUVs. 
North American Specs

The Focus Active is supposed to be noticeably different from the current Focus offerings. Ford hopes to combine "the best attributes of cars and utilities-such as higher ride height, space and versatility." The expectation is that it will be less boxy than most crossovers and shorter than most wagons. The most similar car currently (as of April 2018) on the market is the Subaru Crosstrek. The Focus Active is supposed to be lifted and have roof rails, however it is not expected to have standard all-wheel drive, which makes it unique in this category. 

So far, it is expected that there only be one spec offering in the U.S. 

European Specs

More is known about the Focus Active that will be available in Europe. There will be four power train options, including two diesel options. Both manual and automatic transmission will be available. The technology will include active park assist, adaptive cruise control, blind spot assist, forward collision warning, hands free power lift gate, heated steering wheel, and a panoramic sunroof. 

In addition to the power train options, there are expected to be at least two trim options, including the ST and RS. There are also expected to be sedan and wagon body options available.

César Armando Librado Legorreta

César Armando Librado Legorreta (born 1981 in Tenango del Valle) is a Mexican serial killer known as "El Coqueta", who was convicted of six rapes and murders of women in the Greater Mexico City.

Legoretta's modus operandi was to take advantage of his job as a driver on Route 2 that runs from Metro Chapultepec to Tlalnepantla de Baz, where late at night and early in the morning he would rape and kill women aged between 17 and 34. To commit his act, he simulated that his vehicle had broken down; he would then drop off all the passengers except one girl, then offered to take her outside if she wanted to help fix the problem, but before arriving at the place he would change the route, rape the girl and kill her afterwards, dropping her body in the Tlalnepantla channel. Sometimes this method would vary, since the victim would be the last passenger before arriving at the destination.

César Armando Librado Legorreta, "El Coqueto", is 31 years old, lived in the municipality fo Tultitlán with his wife and two children, worked as a driver on Route 2 through public transport driving a minibus with registration 712TL066, where he committed his murders. According to the investigation folder that was made after his capture and trial, his first crime was committed on July 14, 2011; his second on November 26; his third on December 13 and his fourth on the 30th. His last two murders were committed in December 8 and 18, 2012, respectively.

Initially he was captured on February 26 in the Federal District, and was arrested and transferred to the facilities of the Deputy Attorney General's Office, based in Barrientos de la Vega.

He was connected to eight feminicides committed in the Metropolitan Area, where the killer was driving a minibus that ran from Valle Dorado to Chapultepec, but he evaded the facilities of the Attorney General's Office of the State of Mexico. The authorities offered a million pesos for information leading to the arrest of Librado Legoretta. Finally, on March 3, 2012, agents of Magdalena Contreras borough learned his location. With the reforms to the Penal Code of the State of Mexico at the end of the year 2011, if convicted, it would be the first case of life imprisonment for feminicide and rape in Mexico.

César Armando escaped from the Deputy Attorney General of Tlalnepantla; After the PGJEM reported that he had been arrested for multiple homicides and rapes over the weekend, early morning Armando eloped with the help of his guards, state prosecutor Alfredo Castillo confirmed. He explained that by not having the figure of arraigo, detainees can only be cared for but without violating their individual guarantees, so in any oversight, such as this case, they can escape.

He explained that in the early hours of Sunday morning to Monday, the agent of Public Ministry realized that both the detainee and the three ministerial policemen were not in the facilities. After the release of the news, the police started tracking them down.

"This Tuesday at dawn one of the three ministerial policemen was arrested, saying that upon realizing that this person had jumped off out of a window and knowing they would be blamed, they fled as not to be detained", Castillo Cervantes said.

Despite the error, the prosecutor said that in the next few hours Armando will be arrested because his arrest was after months of investigation, so "we have it perfectly located, now it will be easier to stop him".

He said that they discharged the ministerial policemen for negligence and attempting to flee.

Finally, on Saturday, March 3, 2012, agents of the Attorney General's Office of the State of Mexico in Magdalena Contreras recaptured Armando.

On December 12, 2012, Legoretta was convicted and sentenced to 240 years in prison for the rape and murder of six women.

In Teria volcanic field is a volcanic field in Algeria. It consists of about 20 craters.

In Teria is located close to Illizi. The field consists of about twenty explosion craters and tuff rings in a terrain of , which were possibly formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions. None of the craters exceeds in width.

This volcanic field lies northeast of Hoggar. Volcanism in northern Africa, such as in Darfur, Hoggar and Tibesti, has variously been proposed to be due to mantle plumes, reactivated tectonic lineaments in the crust and several more geologic mechanisms. In Hoggar, after Cenozoic uplift, volcanism peaked in the Miocene after an Eocene start and continued to this day.

The field has also produced lapilli, lava bombs and melilitic rocks which contain xenoliths. Minerals found at In Teria include granite, granulite, garnet and spinel peridotite, phlogopite, phlogopitite and pyroxenite. These xenoliths have interacted with melts and testify to the presence of old, thick lithosphere.

The field was emplaced during the Quaternary, with possible Holocene activity.

William Robson (writer)

William Robson (1785/6–1863) was a British author and translator.

Robson was educated in Chertsey, at a school run by John Harris Wicks. He went into teaching himself. Around 1813 he formed a close friendship with John Taylor the publisher. Through Taylor he was on the fringes of the group producing "The London Magazine" of 1820 to 1829, with James Augustus Hessey, Charles Lamb and John Hamilton Reynolds.

Robson's first career was as a schoolmaster. He was headmaster of Chingford Lodge Academy in Edmonton, London from 1835, but suffered financial losses.

At that point past age 50, Robson then concentrated on writing. In later life, he fell into poverty. He died on 17 November 1863: George Routledge the publisher had raised a public subscription for him, but he had not yet had the benefit of it.

Robson wrote:


Robson also translated French works, including: Joseph François Michaud's "History of the Crusades", 1852; Alexandre Dumas's "Three Musketeers", 1853; and Balzac's "Balthazar", 1859.

Joey Carbstrong

Joey Carbstrong (born 1986) is an Australian animal rights activist. A former alcohol and drug addict and an ex-member of a criminal gang, he made a remarkable turnaround, becoming a vegan animal liberation activist known for his sobriety. He describes himself as a militant vegan campaigner.

Joey was born Joseph Armstrong. His mother's name is Vania. He has a brother named Josh and a sister named Miki. A native of Adelaide, he quit school early at the age of 14 and developed a heavy addiction towards drugs and alcohol. Joey started with cannabis when he was 14, turning to alcohol and methamphetamine at 15, and ecstasy and hallucinogens at 16, soon using heroin, cocaine, and benzodiazepines. He went to various jobs in Adelaide, including one at a car factory and as a building laborer. By 22, Joey's drug dependency worsened and he went on welfare. Soon he became a gangster, amassing a lengthy criminal record, including three assaults. Joey was kept under house arrest for 18 months. His mother Vania described him as "the most scariest creature I have ever come across." His brother described him as "very stabby, very violent," recalling how he had beaten him up, and his sister said, "I remember when you stabbed someone."

Joey was arrested in September 2011 when the police discovered him holding a firearm in his trousers, which he "apparently planned to take to a drug deal." Police found found 29 bullets hidden in a sock inside a chair lining in his motel room, along with a flick-knife hidden beneath his mattress and another inside the hood of his jacket. They also found several luxury Rolex and Tag Heuer watches. At the time of his arrest, Joey had a methamphetamine habit of half a gram a day costing about $AUS400 per day. He spent six months in prison, where he had an enlightenment. Soon he decided to depart from the criminal world. Inspired by the teachings of Dan McDonald, an American advocate for raw food and fasting, Joey became vegan after his release from the prison.

In May 2017, Joey released a video to celebrate his completion of four years as a teetotaler.

As of 2018, Joey Carbstrong has more than 50,000 followers on social media, including on YouTube and Instagram.

Lutheran art

Lutheran art consists of all visual works produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of the Lutheran Churches. This includes sculpture, painting, and architecture. Artwork in the Lutheran Churches arose as a distinct marker of the faith during the Reformation era and served to promulgate Lutheran theology.

Martin Luther, the founder of the Lutheran Churches, encouraged the display of religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church". He defended the use of "importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion", stating that "If it is not a sin but good to have the image of Christ in my heart, why should it be a sin to have it in my eyes?" 

A few Lutheran altarpieces, including those of the Last Supper, were commissioned under his purview. The "Schneeberg Altarpiece" was placed at the high altar of St. Wolfgang im Salzkammergut and as Lutheran sacred imagery, reflected "the devotional forms of fifteenth- and early sixteenth century northern art". The "Schneeberg Altarpiece" (1539), along with the "Wittenberg Altarpiece" (1547) and the "Weimar Altarpiece" (1555), were Christocentric in their iconography and "these altarpieces reinforced the key teachings of the new church and helped consolidate a sense of confessional identity." Within eastern Germany alone, Lutheran patrons erected thirty new altarpieces. Most pre-Reformation altarpieces were preserved within Lutheran churches as the "altar was still believed to be a particularly holy place, and should be adorned accordingly." 

Lutheran sacred art gained a new function in addition to exciting one's mind to thoughts of the Divine by also serving a didactic purpose. The "Law and Gospel" by Lutheran painter Lucas Cranach the Elder, for example, "enshrines the specific authority of the word of the Bible by including biblical passages as prominent parts of the composition." Lutheranism was responsible for "an explosion of creativity in the graphic arts" with works such as "Passional Christi und Antichristi" by Philipp Melanchthon, being described as "richly illustrated".

With respect to the Divine Service, "Lutheran worship became a complex ritual choreography set in a richly furnished church interior."
Ornate church interiors in Lutheran churches reflected Lutheran Eucharistic theology, which taught the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist as a sacramental union. Lutheran churches, as well as homes, displayed a prominent crucifix as it highlighted their high view of the Theology of the Cross. It became a popular devotional image for Lutherans, who "prayed, meditated, and even wept before them." Thus, for Lutherans, "the Reformation renewed rather than removed the religious image."

During the Great Iconoclasm, bands of Calvinists removed sacred art from churches that adopted the Reformed faith. Lutherans generally opposed the iconoclasm, one saying: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return". As such, Calvinist iconoclasm, "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany. Lutheran theologian and priest Johann Arndt was forced to flee Anhalt when it became Calvinist in the 1580s, due to his defense of Christian sacred art. He wrote a treatise "Ikonographia", in which he criticized the Reformed faith for consecrating the Eucharistic elements on wooden tables rather than on stone altars. As Calvinism, along with its associated aniconism spread, "Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images."

Artists who designed Lutheran Baroque art not only took their inspiration from Martin Luther, but from popular Lutheran piety in the latter part of the 16th and 17th centuries. The Dresden Frauenkirche serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden:

In the second half of the 17th century, high baroque art continued to spread through Saxony, under the rule of Johann Georg. Pieces like the altar of Johanneskirche resembled the "Descent from the Cross" by Peter Paul Rubens.

More typically, Daniel Hisgen (1733-1812) was a German painter of the rococo period who worked as a painter of Lutheran churches in Upper Hesse, specializing on cycles of paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in churches with an upper gallery. His discreet cycles demonstrate the modest prominence expected of Lutheran art in German churches of his day, taking a middle route between the large and prominent images in Catholic churches, and the complete absence of images in Calvinist ones.

In the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, several Lutheran altarpieces were designed and housed within parish churches. Many of these were designed by artists such as Carl Bloch and Joakim Skovgaard.

With respect to artwork adorning Lutheran churches in the modern era:

Within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, religious artists including Arne Haugen Sørensen, Peter Brandes, Hein Heinsen and Maja Lisa Engelhardt continue to design Lutheran art today. Many German Lutheran churches retain pre-Reformation Marian altarpieces.

Pfaffenthal-Kirchberg railway station

Pfaffenthal-Kirchberg railway station is a rail station in the north of Luxembourg City which opened in December 2017. It is located on Rue St Mathieu in the Pfaffenthal valley, below the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge and overlooks the Alzette river. The "Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois" (CFL), the state-owned rail company, operates both it and the accompanying funicular line, which links the station to tram services on the Kirchberg plateau. 

The plans for the station and the associated funicular, and tram projects were presented in September 2011 as is part of the Luxembourg government's wider sustainable mobility strategy. Its aim to reduce travel time for cross border and domestic rail commuters to the Kirchberg district of Luxembourg City, the location of many European Union (EU) institutions, including the Court of Justice of the European Union, and a growing commercial sector. Prior to completion, rail commuters to the Kirchberg plateau would have to alight at the central Luxembourg station and make a further commute across the city.;

The pre-construction analysis took place between 2013 and 2014, with construction works spanning from March 2015, to late 2017. The station and the accompanying funicular line is estimated, at the time of construction, to have cost 96 million euros.
Step-free access is available throughout the station. Elevators and escalators connect both platforms to the enclosed footbridge for interchanges, with further elevators providing access from the Rue St Mathieu entrance to platform 2 and the footbridge, and the funicular above platform 1 providing access from Avenue John F. Kennedy to the station. 

Due to the decision not to charge passengers for use of the funicular, the funicular, via the station provides a step-free access route for pedestrians and cyclists from the Kirchberg plateau to the Pfaffenthal valley below.

Pfaffenthal-Kirchberg station is served by trains from the InterCity (IC), Regional-Express (RE) and Regionalbahn (RB) services


The station is currently served by four trains per hour, which will increase to 6 in 2020 following the expected completion of works to extend Luxembourg railway station and to allow increased traffic at Dommeldange station.

The station is served by the Pffafenthal-Kirchberg funicular which makes the steep ascent to the end of the main thoroughfare on the Kirchberg Quater, Avenue John F. Kennedy, allowing for use of the connecting tramstop at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge. In addition, a range of bus services are available from the Kirchberg funicular station, including the municipal AVL lines 1, 7, 8, 16, 18 and 20 and regional bus lines 120, 125, 130, 142, 144, 165, 172, 192, 194, 195, 213, 222, 262, 282 and 740. In addition, the St Mathieu entrance to the station in the Pffafenthal valley is served by the AVL 23 bus.

The station has 2 paid secure cycle storage facilities, providing a total of 32 spaces, with a third providing an additional 46 spaces located at the Kirchberg level accessible via the funicular.

Flathead motorcycles

Sidevalve designs have been used on a number of flathead motorcycles, in particular early US V-twins such as Harley-Davidson and Indian, some early British singles, early BMW flat twins, and Russian copies thereof.
The flathead engine saw service in Harley-Davidson motorcycles beginning with the Model W's flat-twin, produced from 1919 to 1923, and continuing in 1924 with single-cylinder export-model and singles and continued in Servi-Cars until 1973. In the domestic U.S. market, the (primary VIN letter) D model (1929 to 1931) and its technical descendant, the (primary VIN letter) R model (1932 to 1936), started Harley's side-valve tradition in the 45-cubic-inch displacement class. The D and R models featured a total-loss oiling system and were succeeded in 1937 by the (primary VIN letter) W 45, which had recirculating oil lubrication. The WLA (W = return oil, L = performance, A = army) went on to serve in World War II as the U.S. and Canadian Army's WLC (C = Canada) primary two-wheeled mount and subsequently as a civilian middleweight through 1952. The engine continued virtually unchanged with 2.745" bore and 3.8125" stroke with various G-based designations in the three-wheeled Servi-Car until production ceased in 1973.

In 1952, the K series flatheads was introduced with the same bore and stroke, selling in parallel with the W series (which was discontinued after 1952), designed to compete with British sporting motorcycles of the time. The K models featured a 750cc unit construction engine and transmission case, right side foot shift and left side foot brake. From 1954 to 1956, the KH received an increase in stroke to 4-9/16" to bring displacement to 888cc (54 cubic inches). 

The American Motorcycle Association (AMA) class C rules of 1952 allowed sidevalves of 750cc to compete against 500cc overhead valve bikes. The 750cc KR factory racer was highly competitive in dirt track and road racing, and was produced in limited numbers until 1969
, when the AMA changed the rules by increasing the Class C displacement limit to 750 cc. Without the displacement advantage, the KR flatheads were not competitive against 750 cc overhead valve bikes.

In 1930, the VL flathead replaced the JD Big Twin, which had featured intake-over-exhaust (IoE) valve configuration. The VL had a single downtube frame and total loss oiling, culminating in an version (VLH) in 1935. In 1937, that engine was redesigned to include a recirculating lubrication system, and designated the model U, and it went into the same frame and running gear configuration as the model E Knucklehead, which had originated in 1936. The U continued to be produced in varying configurations as a 74 cubic inch U & UL (1937 to 1948), and 80 cubic inch UH & ULH engine (1937 to 1941). By that time, the first year of the aluminum-head Panhead, it had been thoroughly superseded and outsold in the marketplace by the superior performance of the overhead valve model Big Twins.

Amnesia Fortnight 2017

Amnesia Fortnight 2017 is a bundle of prototypes made during a two-week public prototyping session in 2017 by Double Fine Productions, which was held in conjunction with Humble Bundle in 2017. Everyone that paid a minimum of $1 had the opportunity to vote on 25 concept ideas from employees. After the completion of the voting period, the top two picks were developed into prototypes. In addition, Tim Schafer chose an additional prototype, and the Double Fine Productions staff that was working on Amnesia Fortnight chose another. This was done to give the team a bit of control, rather than have all of the choices be as a result of online voting. Double Fine developed these four concept ideas from employees into game prototypes that became available to those that purchased the bundle after they were completed. 

In addition, fan projects were also included this year. Three fan pitches were presented in a video and everyone that paid a minimum of $1 could choose between the three pitches. All three games, Pongball, Amnesia Adventure and The Lost Dev Team were developed into prototypes by fans. The top choice, Pongball, was included with the Amnesia Fortnight downloads.

2 Player Productions filmed a documentary about the making of the prototypes, which was also released on YouTube.

"I Have No Idea What I'm Doing" was Tim Schafer's choice. It is a multi-player virtual reality party game that was led by Zak McClendon. One player wears the headset, and the players not wearing the headset play using the standard display.

"Kiln" was the Double Fine Productions team's choice.

"The Gods Must Be Hungry" was the top fan choice.

"Darwin's Dinner" was the second fan choice. 

"Pongball" was the top choice for the fan-developed prototype. It is a multi-player Pong game with pinball-like playfields. It was conceptualized by Kjell "lightsoda" Iwarson and led by Josh "Cheeseness" Bush.

"The Lost Dev Team" was the second fan-developed prototype. It is a single player puzzle platformer akin to The Lost Vikings or The Cave. In the game, three game developers, a programmer, a musician, and an artist, have to use their unique skills to get past various puzzles. It was conceptualized by Anenome and led by Jennifer "Jenni" McMurray.

Amnesia Adventure was the third fan-developed prototype. It is an adventure game with differently styled scenes, wherein an amnesiac adventurer relives past adventures through memories. It was conceptualized by Ben "TimeGentlemen" Ward of Size Five Games, and led by Jennifer "Jenni" McMurray and Eivind "flesk" Nilsbakken.

James Sterling (1701–1763) was an Irish cleric and poet.

The son of James Sterling, he entered Trinity College, Dublin as a scholar in 1718, graduating B.A. in 1720 and M.A. in 1733. In that year he went to London with his friend Matthew Concanen. 

In November 1737 Sterling took a living in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He was from 1739 the minister of the Episcopal St. Paul's Church near Chestertown. His ministry lasted to 1763, and saw the brick church doubled in size.

Sterling travelled to London in 1752. He had associated in a scheme, with Benjamin Franklin who brought in backers from Philadelphia, to develop the North-West Passage. Franklin had become a sponsor of Captain Charles Swaine, who eventually made a Labrador Sea expedition in the "Argo", in 1753. Sterling, however, struck out on his own, with a group of London merchants, and went to the Board of Trade for them, seeking exclusive rights to trade on the Labrador coast. Plans came to nothing, when the Board favoured the Hudson Bay Company instead.

Sterling published: 


In 1724 Sterling made three contributions to Concanen's "Poems", signed "J. S."

Sterling married, firstly, Nancy Lyddell, who had acted in "The Rival Generals" in Dublin. In 1723 they went on to London, and Nancy made her stage debut there. She had died by 1733. In Maryland, he married in 1743 Rebecca Holt, widow of the Rev. Arthur Holt, and they had a daughter Rebecca, who married William Carmichael. He married as his third wife Mary Smith, in 1749.

Endo contractualization

Endo refers to an short-term employment practice in the Philippines. It is a form of contractualization which involves companies giving workers temporary employment that last less than six months.

The word Endo is derived from an abridged version of the phrase "end of contract". Endo is also sometimes refereed to "5-5-5". Under the Labor Code of the Philippines, employers may employ people under a probationary status of not exceeding six months after which they become regular employees which under the law may enjoy benefits such as leaves and 13th month pay. Under the endo system the worker's employment contract ends before the six month by their employer.

Under the endo practice, employer may hire personnel batch by batch, with each employed under a 5-month contract. At the end of the period, also known as "end of contract" (E.O.C.), employees are replaced by another batch of employees also under a 5-month period.

<doc id="57292314" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57292314" title="Penang state election, 2008">
Penang state election, 2008

The 12th Penang election was held on 8 March 2008. Polling took place in 40 constituencies throughout the State of Penang, with each electing a State Assemblyman to the Penang State Legislative Assembly. The election was conducted by the Malaysian Election Commission.

The legislative body had been dissolved on 13 February by the Governor of Penang, Abdul Rahman Abbas, on the advice of the incumbent Chief Minister, Koh Tsu Koon, who also led the state's ruling coalition at the time, Barisan Nasional (BN). Opposing the BN was the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) alliance, which consisted of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), the People's Justice Party (PKR) and the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS). Electoral candidates were nominated on 24 February.

The election proved to be a watershed in Penang's history, as the BN was handed an unprecedented and shocking defeat by the PR, making the election the second time Penang's government was voted out of power; the first was in 1969. The PR won 29 out of the 40 seats, gaining more than a two-thirds majority in the Penang State Legislative Assembly. The leader of the PR in Penang, Lim Guan Eng, was subsequently sworn into power as Penang's fourth Chief Minister on 11 March.

The election was the 12th state election in the State of Penang since the independence of Malaya (now Malaysia) in 1957. The governing Barisan Nasional (BN) sought to secure their ninth consecutive term in office since 1974.

According to the Constitution of the State of Penang, the maximum term of the Penang State Legislative Assembly, the legislature of Penang, is five years from the date of the first sitting of Assembly following a state election, after which it is dissolved by operation of law. However, the Chief Minister, as the head of government in Penang, may advise the Governor, the head of state, to dissolve the Assembly before the five-year period is up.

On 13 February 2008, the Governor of Penang, Abdul Rahman Abbas, gave his consent to the incumbent Chief Minister of Penang, Koh Tsu Koon, to dissolve the Assembly; the dissolution of the Assembly was conducted simultaneously with the dissolution of the Malaysian Parliament.

A state election must be held within sixty days after the dissolution. Accordingly, the Malaysian Election Commission set 24 February as the nomination day and 8 March as the polling day, providing for a campaigning period of 13 days.

The Barisan Nasional (BN), the ruling coalition in Penang at the time, had been in power since 1955, although BN rule was briefly interrupted after the 1969 election when Gerakan, then an opposition party, seized power in the state; Gerakan subsequently joined the BN in 1973.

Prior to the election, BN, which was led by the incumbent Chief Minister of Penang and Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan) leader, Koh Tsu Koon, controlled 38 out of the 40 state seats in the Penang State Legislative Assembly. BN was opposed by the informal Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition, which held the remaining two seats in the Assembly. PR was led by the secretary-general of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), Lim Guan Eng.

All 40 state constituencies within Penang, which constitute the Penang State Legislative Assembly, were contested during the election.

In the preceding years, concerns had been raised over the perceived decline and neglect of Penang. Among the factors were the deteriorating cleanliness in George Town, incoherent urban planning, poor traffic management, the state's economic slowdown and persistent brain drain.

By the early 2000s, Penang's economic growth began to lose steam, with the city-state recording the lowest monthly household income growth rate amongst the Malaysian states. Also in 2001, the Rent Control Act, which until then had protected the low-income residents within the George Town city centre from eviction by preventing any arbitrary hike in rents, was repealed. Consequently, the city centre was hollowed out, as residents and smaller businesses were unable to cope with the rental hikes. This led to the dilapidation of heritage buildings within the city centre, whilst private developers began demolishing pre-war buildings in the name of redevelopment. In addition, the decades of brain drain took its toll, as Penang suffered a shortage of professionals, who generally preferred to move to the Greater Kuala Lumpur area for business and employment opportunities. Poor urban planning and traffic management caused worsening traffic congestion, whilst George Town's garbage-strewn streets led to Penang being labelled a ""garbage state"" by Barisan Nasional (BN) politicians.

Widespread discontent over Penang's decline led to campaigns by Penang-based non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the national media to return the city-state to its former glory.

Prior to the election, Koh Tsu Koon had stated his intention to resign as the Chief Minister of Penang, in order to stand for a position in the national Cabinet; during the election, Koh stood in the Batu Kawan parliamentary constituency. Subsequently, internal squabbles broke out within the Barisan Nasional (BN) over the next person to helm the position of the Chief Minister. While Koh picked Teng Hock Nam to succeed him as the Chief Minister, the then Malaysian Prime Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, preferred Teng Chang Yeow to succeed Koh. Other BN leaders who also contended for the position of the Chief Minister were Chia Kwang Chye and Lee Kah Choon.

The internal infighting, exacerbated by Koh's indecisiveness, adversely affected BN's campaign in Penang, as the coalition was unable to publicly declare its Chief Minister-designate. In addition, Koh's decision to run for a higher position in the Malaysian federal government was widely scorned; Penangites perceived Koh's party, Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia, as being more interested in promoting its political ambitions in the national level instead of seeing to its constituents' needs.

Allegations of corrupt practices by the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration were also abound prior to the election. In early 2008, an online news portal alleged that the incumbent Chief Minister, Koh Tsu Koon, had spent RM10 billion to persuade Motorola to stay in Penang. While Koh initially refused comment, he finally admitted to the issue.

The BN administration was also condemned by Penang-based non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for steamrolling the Penang Global City Centre project, which was the brainchild of Partick Lim, a tycoon who maintained close ties with the then Malaysian Prime Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Despite opposition by the NGOs, the BN administration proceeded with the project by bypassing the Penang Island Municipal Council (now Penang Island City Council), thus eliminating any need for approval from the local government. The issue strengthened the perception that Chief Minister Koh, who led Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan), displayed utmost deference to the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant party within the BN coalition.

BN's maladministration extended to Penang's two local governments - the Penang Island Municipal Council and the Seberang Perai Municipal Council - which were under the purview of the BN-controlled state government. Both local governments accrued large annual deficits in the preceding years, but more so for the Seberang Perai Municipal Council, which had its lavish headquarters near Bukit Mertajam completed in 2006. Despite this, the Seberang Perai Municipal Council was led by UMNO-appointed councillors, which gave it better access to the UMNO-dominated Malaysian federal government, whereas the Penang Island Municipal Council, headed by Gerakan appointees, did not enjoy such a benefit.

The Barisan Nasional (BN) administration in Penang, plagued by various crises, sought to appeal to the clamour of change by employing the slogan ""keep reinventing"". Even so, the BN had the advantage of incumbency and the backing of the UMNO-led Malaysian federal government. By contrast, the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) coalition, which lacked the resources available to its opponent, launched its theme ""just change it"", heralding a more aggressive campaign to overthrow the BN-controlled state government.

Due to Barisan Nasional's control of the traditional mainstream media, including newspapers, television and radio, the Pakatan Rakyat (PR), led by the Democratic Action Party (DAP), turned to other methods of reaching out to voters. The election was notable for being the first election that was influenced by the alternative media, such as websites, blogs and news portals. The Internet played a vital role in PR's campaign, by allowing critics of the BN administration to air their views on issues which had been deliberately ignored by the mainstream media. The DAP sought to tap into its booming online presence by nominating Jeff Ooi, a blogger, as its candidate for the Jelutong parliamentary constituency on Penang Island.

Owing to the increasing use of mobile phones, the short messaging service (SMS) was also put to use to disseminate information regarding PR rallies during the campaigning period. In addition, voters could register their phone numbers at DAP offices to receive campaign information via SMS.

Both political coalitions held rallies, known in Malay as "ceramah", throughout the state during the campaigning period just prior to the polling day. Pakatan Rakyat (PR) rallies, in particular, drew massive turnouts and generated a sizeable sum of donations. By contrast, Barisan Nasional (BN) rallies attracted very few attendees, so much so that some were reportedly cancelled due to the sheer lack of audience.

On 1 March 2008, a PR rally was held at the Han Chiang College in George Town. Among the key speakers in the rally were Lim Guan Eng, Karpal Singh, Jeff Ooi and Anwar Ibrahim. A 10,000-strong crowd attended the rally, which also broke the record for the highest amount of donation collected at that point; RM38,000 were collected during the rally. The rally at Han Chiang College was surpassed only a few days later, when on 6 March, more than 60,000 people thronged the same venue for another PR rally, during which over RM133,000 were collected.

The polling on 8 March 2008 was closed by 5.00 p.m. Malaysian time, and was immediately followed by the counting of votes. Preliminary results, streamed online by Malaysiakini, indicated that the Pakatan Rakyat (PR) was in the lead. Unofficial results continued to trickle in throughout the evening as seat after seat, beginning with Pulau Tikus, fell to the PR. By 9.00 p.m., the Malaysian Election Commission confirmed that the Democratic Action Party (DAP), a component party of the PR, won all of the 19 state constituencies it was contesting in Penang.

The outgoing Chief Minister of Penang and the state's Barisan Nasional (BN) leader, Koh Tsu Koon, immediately informed the Governor of Penang, Abdul Rahman Abbas, of the electoral results and subsequently called Penang DAP chairman, Chow Kon Yeow, to congratulate him. At 11.45 p.m., Koh publicly conceded defeat in a televised press conference.

At 12.30 a.m. on 9 March, the top leaders of the PR, led by Lim Guan Eng, held a press conference at the Red Rock Hotel in George Town. Lim thanked Penangites for ""allowing the opposition parties to form the Penang state government"", and announced that the DAP would form the new state government in cooperation with the People's Justice Party (PKR) and the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS).""DAP wishes to state that we will form the next Penang state government in cooperation and coalition with PKR, a government for all Malaysians, embracing Malays, Chinese, Indians and other races... We also hope that the PAS elected wakil rakyat (State Assemblyman) can help this new government."" - Lim Guan EngDuring the night, the elected PR State Assemblymen were instructed to remain indoors for fear of reprisals by BN extremists, with their mobile phones kept away to prevent any of the State Assemblymen from being bought over by the BN. PR suppporters were also told not to hold street celebrations to prevent any outbreak of post-election violence. PR politicians wished to avoid a repeat of the 1969 race riots in Kuala Lumpur, which occurred after the General Election that year. For similar reasons, Lim Kit Siang, a DAP politician who was in Ipoh at the time, immediately despatched bodyguards over to Lim Guan Eng in Penang.

The election marked the second time the incumbent Penang state government was voted out of power; the first was in 1969. For the first time ever, BN's component parties, Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), lost all their state constituencies and were wiped out of Penang's political scene altogether. The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), BN's dominant party, became the sole BN party remaining in Penang, securing 11 seats; UMNO thus formed the opposition within the state. Meanwhile, the PR swept 29 out of the 40 seats that form the Penang State Legislative Assembly, winning more than a two-thirds majority in the legislature.

The elected Chief Minister of Penang, Lim Guan Eng, met his predecessor, Koh Tsu Koon, in the Office of the Chief Minister of Penang inside Komtar in George Town on 9 March 2008, promising a smooth transition of power. Lim was sworn in as the Chief Minister in the presence of the Governor of Penang, Abdul Rahman Abbas, at the latter's official residence, The Residency, in George Town at 10.05 a.m. on 11 March.

Chief Minister Lim's first task in office was to waive all summonses and parking tickets issued by both the Penang Island Municipal Council and the Seberang Perai Municipal Council before March 2008. He also began instituting the CAT policy (Competency, Accountability and Transparency) in the Penang state government; in an unprecedented move, Chief Minister Lim himself took to answering questions posed to him online and via press conferences. The CAT policy entails the adoption of the open tender system for state government contracts and projects, to avoid corruption and to promote transparency. Lavish expenses made by the previous state government were cut down as well.

In addition, one of the major initiatives of the new PR-led Penang state government was to abolish the controversial New Economic Policy, which had been implemented throughout Malaysia by the Barisan Nasional since 1971. The decision, which was aimed at refocusing the state government's efforts towards eradicating poverty regardless of ethnicity, was agreed upon by the People's Justice Party (PKR), with the party's leader, Anwar Ibrahim, pledging to ""stop this practice of awarding tenders, projects and privatisation to family-related companies and cronies only at states where we are in charge"". BN extremists, particularly those from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), subsequently held a protest outside Komtar on 14 March.

Following the drastic change in Malaysia's political landscape, Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore, visited Penang and met Chief Minister Lim on 13 June 2009. During the visit, Lee remarked on Penang's poorly-maintained infrastructure at the time and opined that one term was inadequate for Chief Minister Lim to implement the necessary changes within Penang.
