<doc id="57292724" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57292724" title="CUS Roma Rugby">
CUS Roma Rugby

CUS Roma Rugby is the rugby union section of Centro Universitario Sportivo di Roma, founded in 1947.During its history, the team took part in several national first division championships and won the Coppa Italia during the 1966-67 season.

Due to financiary problems, the union rejected the application of the universitary team to the 2016-2017 Serie B season and the team is at risk of disappearing. In CUS Roma for that season it only remains the under-18 team which decides to take part ot the regional championship where it reached the second place.

The "CUS Roma Rugby" is born officially in 1947 as the rugby union section of the Centro Universitario Sportivo di Roma, which collects the legacy of the universitary sports group of the fascist era. Under the name GUF Roma, the team took part in serie A from 1934/35 to 1942/43, last championship played before the suspension due to the bellic events.

In 1950-51 CUS Roma is the first university club in the post-war to return in the top division. It was a short-lived experience, terminated with the relegation in serie B. In 1956-57 the team takes part again in serie A, where they manage to resist for three consecutive seasons.

The first golden age for CUS Roma opens in 1962-63 with the return in the top division. The university club was suddenly projected to the top of the Italian rugby union. In 1964-65 and in 1965-66 CUS was in the second place for two conecutive times behind the eventual Italian champions, Partenope.

In 1966-67 the team reaches the third place, behind L'Aquila and the eventual champions, Fiamme Oro Padova. In the same season, in a historic final, CUS Roma beats CUS Torino 15-3 and wins the first edition of  Coppa Italia.

The magical era stopped abruptly the following year, when CUS experienced one of the several splits that devastated its history.The entire team passed in block to Buscaglione Roma, a newly-formed team which acquired CUS' sports tile and the right to take part to the top division. The university club had to start over. The team would not return to Serie A until the summer of 1974, with the victory against CUS Napoli in the decisive play-off which was played inL'Aquila, even if the permanence in the top division that time lasted the timespan of one season. 

The club's importance at dometstic level is winessed also by the election of Sergio Luzzi-Conti, former head of the rugby union section and then e CUS Roma president, to the office of president of Federazione Italiana Rugby, which he mantained from 1971 to 1974. In 1973 Luzzi-Conti was the inspirator of Italy first tour in South Africa, which marked an important breakthrough for the Italian rugby union.

The second CUS Roma Rugby's golden age was in the 1980s, with Alberto Gualtieri as chairman.The university club returns in Serie A for a season in 1982-83, but it was not until 1986-87 where the journey of a generation of new talents started. In four consecutive seasons the team takes parte to the Serie A1, new name assumed by the top division. In those years the championship registered the presence of the most important international players, who joined from the major Italian clubs. In the historic Acqua Acetosa field, CUS faced several rugby stars such as David Campese, John Kirwan and Naas Botha.

Notwithstanding with the disproportion between the forces in field, CUS Roma does not demeritsi, according to many fans, exprimed the most beautiful and spectacular game of the championship, thanks to the quality of its backs. Many CUS players in those years were called up in the national team (Tinari, Pratichetti, Caranci, Salvati, De Biase, Ambrosio, to cite a few names). The player that was a symbol of that generation was Stefano Barba, centre with outstanding attack abilites who took part at the  1987 Rugby World Cup and collected more than 30 caps for Italy.

In the same years the youth sector was submitted to a development, which reached the top levels of the domestic scene, as demonstrated in the several finals reached in the various categories and  the title of Italian Champion won by the under-17 squad in 1983.84 (under the name "CUS Roma") and in 1985/86 (under the name "Primavera Roma"). However, a breakaway group of executives and coaches of the youth teams in the late 1980s founded an autonomous team, l'U.S. Primavera, where the youth sector growth is still one of the club's main goals. 

In the early 1990s are inaugurated the university sports facilities in Tor di Quinto, where it stands “the biggest rugby field in Italy”. CUS Roma finally had an own playing field. It could be the chance for a further step forward, but the rising financiary restrainments and a series of team vicissitudes marked the start of an era of gradual resizing of the CUS' ambitions.

The first team, relegated in Serie A2 in 1989-90, dispute again a competition in the top division in 1993-94. In the following season the team plays in Serie A2 and is relegated to Serie B to later return in Serie A2 in 1995-96. That season was the last appearance in Serie A. Another split from a group of players and coaches gave birth to Unione Rugby Capitolina, weakening the CUS' organic in all the categories. From 1996-97,CUS Roma Rugby plays in Serie B competition.

In the last two seasons, the entire CUS Roma team lived a fase of society renovation, which brought to the election Gianfranco Morrone as chairman. The renovation affected also the rugby section:the new section Board, made up entirely of players in activity, is working hard to bring back the university rugby team of the capital to its level. At the end of the 2014-15 season, CUS Roma achieved the promotion to Serie A after 19 seasons played in Serie B (see "La storia del CUS" on cusromarugby.com). The 2015-2016  season was not as lucky for the team, which did not manage to remain in the top division, thus being relegated to Serie B.

Moraego

Moraego (or "raego", or "marego"), is the name of a traditional and ritual dance in Central Sulawesi. 

In historical time, Central Sulawesi highlanders have performed circle dances and accompanying songs (in Uma "raego") at all major precolonial rituals. The Moraego dances and songs were performed to summon and communicate with their pre-Christian deities. They were ritual procedures, among other things, to augment the agriculture and human fertility of highland families. In the course of time many dances have become profane dances. The first european missionaries and scholars working in the area debated among themselves by the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century if the dances and the songs held a religious component, or were mere secular entertainment. Missionaries as well as Dutch authorities, sought to reduce the moraego performances for various reasons. For the authorities the problem was that the dances and rituals took time from doing "real work". In the dances there was close physical contact between men and women and this was something european missionaries objected to. Married women did not dance the ´raego, although they and their children were audience to these public events. But the wives participated in the choice and invitation of their husbands dance partners. 

From the end of the 19th century there are several descriptions of the Moraego dances and rituals, especially from the Palu Toradja, the Koro Toradja, as well as the Poso Toradja. Similar dances are also known from the Mori District in East Central Sulawesi and from the so called Saadang Toradja in the south-western part of Central Sulawesi. 

In 1897 Adriani and Kruyt witnessed a raego in Kulawi on their journey across Central Sulawesi. Captain Boonstra van Heerdt, a dutchman records the raego from Kulawi, Lindu and other places. 

Not all ´raego songs were oriented toward courtship activities. Rather, like other ritual speech forms in eastern Indonesia, the songs served more generally as performative elements of religious rituals and as hallowed words that had binding effects on human and deity relations. For example, some types included trance-like chanting that was meant to heal and cure sickness.

While the children were confined to heal and fed only rice porridge after the puberty rites, adults celebrated just outside the temple singing and dancing moraego every night. One animal was sacrificed for every girl and for every three to five boys.

Western Knitting Mills

The Western Knitting Mills is a former industrial building located at 400 Water Street in Rochester, Michigan. The building has been renovated to serve commercial tenants, including Rochester Mills Beer Company. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

In 1844, Hosea B. Richardson built a wool carding and cloth-dressing mill at this location. This original building was destroyed by fire in 1867. A new building, the Rochester Woolen Mill, was constructed soon after, and purchased by Hosea's son Samuel Richardson, who owned the Western Knitting Works in Detroit. This new plant produced woolen goods until it too was destroyed by fire in 1882. In 1891, stockholders in the Western Knitting Works bought out Richardson, reorganized it, and changed the name to Western Knitting Mills Inc. They moved the company's headquarters to Rochester, and built another mill in Middleville, Michigan. In 1896, the company began construction of this plant in Rochester.

The original 1896 plant was constructed in a U-shape, and included a three-story watchtower on one corner, which for use by the village as a night fire watchtower. The mill measures 60,000 square feet, and had its own hydro generating station, two large warehouses and two dormitories on site, as well as a railroad spur directly onto the property. The mill made knitted wool socks, gloves and mittens until 1916, when it began making wool cloth. At some point the U-shaped factory was filled in to make a square, and in 1916 an addition was constructed to handle the cloth making. During World War I, the government commissioned the factory to make khaki gloves for U.S. soldiers.

However, after the war, business began to decline, and the mill closed in 1927. In 1929, the Bradley Knitting Company of Wisconsin purchased the factory to produce yarn and knitted cloth, but the onset of the Great Depression forced the mill to close again in 1931. It reopened briefly in 1933, but soon closed again permanently. After that, several other companies used the factory beginning in the 1940s, including McAleer Manufacturing Company, Higbie Manufacturing, Avon Tube and ITT-Higbie. The last manufacturer, ITT-Higbie, closed the plant in 1993 and sold it to private owners in 1997, who renovated it for commercial use. During and previous to the renovation, the other buildings on the property were demolished, leaving only the 1896 mill in place. The Rochester Mills Beer Company opened in the building in 1998, and as of 2018 still occupies the ground floor.

The Western Knitting Mills factory is a two-story, brick late nineteenth-century mill building with a square plan. The building measures 140 feet by 150 feet. The building has a built-up roof and a fieldstone foundation with a basement. The building is eight bays wide on each original elevation, with bays separated by brick pilasters projecting from the building. The north elevation, originally the interior of the U shape, has three bays on each side of the former courtyard. Each bay contains two windows set in flat arched openings. The windowsills and parapet caps are of stone. The main entry fronts into what is now a parking lot, and is topped with a high parapet and a carved name block which make it a visual focal point.

A three-story fire tower is located on one corner of the building. The original tower was demolished in the early 1900s, but it was reconstructed during the 1997-98 renovation of the building. The tower has a hipped roof with dormers on each side.

Andrew Cochrane

Andrew Cochrane of Brighouse (1693–1777) was an 18th century tobacco lord who served as Lord Provost of Glasgow three times, more than any other person: 1744/5, 1748/9, and 1760/1.

Cochrane Street in central Glasgow was named in his honour in 1787.

He was born in Ayr in 1693 the son of David Cochrane.

He moved to Glasgow in 1722.

In 1723/4 he went into partnership with his brother-in-law John Murdoch (1709-1776) creating the Virginia trading company of Cochrane, Murdoch & Company.

In 1743 he founded the Political Economy Club whose members included Adam Smith.

In 1745 in his role as Lord Provost he had the arduous task of negotiating a levy on the town placed by Bonnie Prince Charlie to support the Jacobite cause, all the harder as Cochrane was a Hanoverian sympathiser. Whilst the ex Lord Provost Andrew Buchanan of Drumpellier (as part of the commission of people resolving the issue) negotiated a drop in the demanded levy from £15,000 to £5,500 the town nevertheless ended paying £14,000 to host the Young Pretender and his army. Cochrane was deeply upset by this and following the defeat of the Jacobite army at the Battle of Culloden he went to London with his brother-in-law George Murdoch (a Bailie and future Lord Provost) to lobby for compensation, eventually being successful the town received £10,000 in 1749.

In 1750 he was one of the first patrons of the odd bank, the Glasgow Tanwork Company )also known as Bell's Tanyards) which combined tanning and banking. It later became the Ship Bank.

In 1761 he was a joint founder (with 25 others) of the Glasgow Arms Bank and also became a partner in Bell's Tanyard which served the curious twin function of bank and tannery.

He died in Glasgow in 1777. A monument to his memory is in the nave of Glasgow Cathedral.

In 1723 he married Janet Murdoch (1699-1786) daughter of Peter Murdoch Lord Provost from 1730 to 1732.

They had no children.

The Maitland Club published the ""Cochrane Correspondence"", a series of his letters concerning governance of the city and council affairs.

Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)

The Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch), commonly known as Territory Labor is the Northern Territory branch of the Australian Labor Party.

The first Labor candidate from the Northern Territory - which was then represented by the Northern Territory seat in the South Australian House of Assembly - was Pine Creek miner and former City of Adelaide alderman James Robertson in 1905. The first Labor MP was Thomas Crush, who was elected at a 1908 by-election and accepted into the South Australian Labor caucus despite not having signed the Labor pledge. He was re-elected in 1910, and served until Northern Territory formally separated from South Australia in 1911, resulting in the loss of the seat in state parliament. A non-voting federal seat in the Australian House of Representatives, the Division of Northern Territory, was established for the 1922 election, and was won by independent candidate and former union leader Harold George Nelson, who joined the Labor caucus after the election.

In March 1928, a general meeting of the North Australian Workers Union resolved to establish a Northern Territory branch of the Labor Party and elected an interim executive. In July 1928, it was reported that the federal secretary had requested that the South Australian branch instead form a Darwin branch. It was reported in October 1928 that affiliation with the South Australian branch had been granted, and that the South Australian state executive had re-endorsed Nelson to contest the 1929 election. An Alice Springs branch was established in 1947. The Northern Territory branch was upgraded to receive the status of a state branch in August 1967.

The Northern Territory Legislative Council was established in 1947 as a partly-elected representative body with limited powers, with the Labor Party endorsing candidates from the first election. Labor members of the Legislative Council included Tom Bell, Eric Marks, Charles Orr, Len Purkiss, Tom Ronan, and Richard Ward 

In 1974, the Legislative Council was replaced by the fully-elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in preparation for self-governance. However, the 1974 election was disastrous for Labor, which failed to win a single seat. The party recovered to some extent at the 1977 election, winning six seats, but remained in opposition until their victory at the 2001 election under Clare Martin. Labor held office until the 2012 election, spent one term in opposition, and returned to power at the 2016 election.

Army of Catalonia (1713-1714)

The Army of the Principality of Catalonia (Catalan: "Exèrcit del Principat de Catalunya") was the army raised by the General Estates of Catalonia (Catalan Courts without the king) on July 9, 1713 after the English treason with the Treaty of Utrecht and the withdrawal of Imperial troops by the L'Hospitalet Agreement. The army was made up of 10,000 men of infantry, 1600 cavalry and 1,000 of navy. It is not known very much how many men formed the artillery but did not exceed 700. In total 13,000 regular troops.

On July 9, 1713, the Principality of Catalonia declared the war to the Kingdom of France and the Duke of Anjou (Philip V of Spain), who since the Catalan constitutions of 1706 did not recognize him as the legitimate king of the Monarchy of Spain and the next day it published a ban to remove troops for the Army of Catalonia, being his first units the Regiment of the Deputation of the General of Catalonia and the Regiment of the City of Barcelona. For the position of general commander of the Army they appointed Lieutenant Marshal Antoni de Villarroel i Peláez on July 10.

Lagos tramway

Lagos steam tramway was a passenger and sanitary tramway that carried cargo and passengers within Lagos Colony. The tram was an important public transit system connecting travelers and merchandise from Ibadan and Abeokuta via the railway terminus at Iddo, mainland Lagos to Port of Lagos. The system ran from 1902 to 1933, it carried passengers and goods for twelve years from 1902 to 1914 and nightsoil from 1906 to 1933.

Between 1901 and 1902, pubic sanitation and mosquito eradication palliatives resulted in the construction of an iron bridge over Five Cowrie Creek and swamp land reclamation projects at Kokomaiko. In 1906, the sanitary tramway, also called Kokomaiko began operations, it ran from Agarawu through Massey Street and Cow Lane via George V road, Onikan crossing over five cowrie bridge to end at Dejection Jetty. The tram carried nightsoil. 

When the colonial government completed the Lagos to Ibadan rail track, the terminal on the Lagos side ended on Lagos mainland and a system had to be devised to link Iddo with the Port of Lagos and other areas on the Island. In 1901, construction commenced of a single track over Carter bridge. The tram was open to the public in 1902, the passenger cars ran northwards from Kokomaiko in the Marina side of Lagos passing customs wharf then turning left into Balogun St to Iddo train terminus via Ereko, Ebute Ero, Idumota and Carter Bridge. The passenger line was one of the earliest public transport system built within Lagos, it carried travelers, traders and workers from the train station at Iddo going to Lagos Island. 

The line was a single track tramway with a 2 ft 6 in gauge and 7 passing loops on the track. There was a run-in at Iddo terminus with sidings to the goods warehouse. The journey from Marina through Carter bridge was 2 miles 58 chains with an average speed of 7 ¾ mph.

Robert Allan (trade unionist)

Robert Allan was a Scottish trade unionist who served as leader of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC).

Allan worked as a compositor in Edinburgh, and joined the Social Democratic Federation. He was active in the Scottish Typographical Association (STA) and the Edinburgh Trades Council. He attended the STUC from its foundation, always taking a prominent part in debates.

Allan was first elected to the General Council of the STUC in 1899, and on the council he championed the creation of a Scottish Labour Representation Committee, to stand Parliamentary candidates on behalf of the socialist, trade union and co-operative movements. This was formed as the Scottish Workers' Representation Committee, and Allan became its first secretary, although in 1902 he was replaced by leader of the STUC, George Carson.

In 1913, Allan stood to become general secretary of the STA, but he took third place with only 581 votes, behind Charles Jackson and the winner, James Brown. He was re-elected to the Parliamentary Committee of the STUC in 1912, and in this role gave some support to the Red Clydeside movement, arguing that its actions were "hasty and unwise", but that the committee should not ignore it, but instead try to give it guidance.

By 1917, Carson was seventy years old and looking to reduce his involvement in the STUC. Allan had developed a strong working relationship with Carson, and was also the STUC President that year. He was seen as the natural choice to become his assistant secretary. The following year, he succeeded Carson as Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee of the STUC, its leading figure. Allan believed that the organisation was ineffective, and gave too much power to small unions. At the 1919 Congress, he proposed adopting a block vote system similar to that used by the Trades Union Congress, but this was opposed by a majority of unions.

Carson persuaded the Parliamentary Committee to found a Labour Institute in Glasgow, as a fitting base for the STUC. He purchased a site, with the STUC meeting monthly repayments, but it was only in 1922 that affiliated unions became aware of the deal. With union memberships falling as unemployment rose, the deal became unaffordable, and Allan was suspended. A couple of days later, he was seriously injured at Carlisle railway station and lost both his legs. In sympathy, he was allowed to stand down on good terms, but never again played a leading role in the trade union movement.

Barracoon: The Story of the Last "Black Cargo" is a non-fiction work by Zora Neale Hurston. It is based on her interviews in 1931 with Cudjo Lewis, the last living survivor of the Middle Passage. The book failed to find a publisher at the time, in part because it was written in vernacular, and also in part because it described the involvement of other Black people in the business of slavery.

Giulio Chierchini

Giulio Ernesto Chierchini (born May 22, 1928 in Genua, Italy ) is an Italian comics writer and artist, mainly known for his Disney work. At the time of writing, he is the oldest still active Disney creator.

His work for Disney Italia started in 1953 when he was inking for Giovan Battista Carpi, who is also his most important artistic influence. The first stories he had drawn entirely himself were published in Topolino 1956. As an author, he debuted in 1964 but didn't start writing regularly until the mid-1970s. Most of his self-penned stories were released in the 1980s, when he was also dabbling with unusual formats: From 1986 to 1995, he wrote and drew several comics which consisted of mostly four "painted panels" per page. These panels were created with a technique that involved airbrush, oil paint and / or watercolour, and subsequently used as the background for "normal" drawings of the main comic figures. For three of these stories, he also created cover illustrations in that style, as featured on Topolino 1707, 1741 and 1891. A few other artists such as Sergio Asteriti, Roberto Marini, Marco Ghighlione, Luciano Gatto and Moreno Chisté (who was also involved with the colouring of some Chierchini comics) also experimented with this two-rows-per-page format in this period. According to Chierchini, these painted panels were well-received by the readers, but weren't to the liking of the Italian editors. 

In this period, Chierchini wrote, painted and drew a lot of stories that featured his creation Little Gum, an alien humanoid duck that eats chewing gum and can use it for various purposes, alongside Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Dewey and Louie. In his first story, Little Gum was introduced as an enemy of Duck Avenger but became an ally of his when the Beagle Boys tried to rob the Money Bin.

In 1994, two Disney comics (co-)written but not drawn by Giulio Chierchini (this was done by Moreno Chisté instead) were released. They turned out to be some of his last published works as a Disney author, as Topolino has not published any stories written by him after 1995. He is nonetheless still working for Topolino as an artist only.

Before he started working for Disney, Chierchini had tried his hand at animation and turned his hand to drawing for various Italian titles ("Volpetto", "Mao & Okey", "Castorino", "Tik Corvo", "Dan Lepre") and created the character/series "Nonna Abelarda". Later in his career, he also worked for the German publisher Kauka.

Together with collaborators Valerio Oss, Moreno Chistè and Sandra Verda, he created a five-hour instructory video for aspiring comic creators.

Leech embryogenesis

Leech embryogenesis is the process by which the embryo of the leech forms and develops. The embryonic development of the larva occurs as a series of stages. During stage 1, the first cleavage occurs, which gives rise to an AB and a CD blastomere, and is in the interphase of this cell division when a yolk-free cytoplasm called teloplasm is formed. The teloplasm is known to be a determinant for the specification of the D cell fate. In stage 3, during the second cleavage, an unequal division occurs in the CD blastomere. As a consequence, it creates a large D cell on the left and a smaller C cell to the right. This unequal division process is dependent on actomyosin, and by the end of stage 3 the AB cell divides. On stage 4 of development, the micromeres and teloblast stem cells are formed and subsequently, the D quadrant divides to form the DM and the DNOPQ teloblast precursor cells. By the end stage 6, the zygote contains a set of 25 micromeres, 3 macromeres (A, B and C) and 10 teloblasts derived from the D quadrant.

The teloblasts are pairs of five different types (M, N, O, P, and Q) of embryonic stem cells that form segmented columns of cells (germinal band) in the surface of the embryo. The M-derived cells make mesoderm and some small set of neurons, N results in neural tissues and some ventral ectoderm, Q contributes to the dorsal ectoderm and O and P in the leech are equipotent cells (same developmental potential) that produce lateral ectoderm; however the difference between the two of them is that P creates bigger batches of dorsolateral epidermis than O. The sludgeworm "Tubifex", unlike the leech, specifies the O and P lineages early in development and therefore, these two cells are not equipotent. Each segment of the body of the leech is generated from one M, O, P cell types and two N and two Q cells types.

The ectoderm and mesoderm of the body trunk are exclusively derived from the teloblast cells in a region called the posterior progress zone. The head of the leech that comes from an unsegmented region, is formed by the first set of micromeres derived from A, B, C and D cells, keeping the bilateral symmetry between the AD and BC cells.

2003 IAAF World Athletics Final – Results

These are the results of the 2003 IAAF World Athletics Final, which took place in at the Stade Louis II in Monte Carlo, Monaco on 13–14 September. The hammer throw events were staged separately on 7 September in Szombathely, Hungary, due to stadium limitations in Monaco.

The competition replaced the IAAF Grand Prix Final, which had a varying set of events each year, with a full set programme of 33 track and field events. The year's top seven athletes, based on their IAAF World Rankings, qualified to compete in each event, with an extra four athletes selected for races of 1500 metres and above. One additional athlete, a wildcard, was allocated to each event by the IAAF and replacement athletes were admitted to replace the qualified athletes that could not attend the final.

Two national records were set at the competition, both in the long jump. Frenchwoman Eunice Barber cleared a French record of while Ignisious Gaisah set a men's Ghanaian record of . Many of the events were affected by the presence of athletes involved in the BALCO scandal, with Dwain Chambers, Zhanna Block, Kelli White, Ramon Clay, Duane Ross, Kevin Toth and Jerome Young all being subsequently disqualified for doping. Young had won the men's 400 metres and White was the women's 200 metres winner.

Holly Union Depot

The Holly Union Depot is a former train station located at 223 South Broad Street in Holly, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

Saw and grist mills were established in what is now Holly in 1843 and 1844, and a village slowly grew up around them. However, real growth only began with the arrival of the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway (later the Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway) in 1855. The D & M Railway constructed a small wooden depot, and soon replaced it with a better one. In 1864, a second railroad line, the Flint and Holly Railroad, was completed into Holly. The two rail lines co-operated to build a union depot to serve both lines, located at the site of the present depot. This wooden depot burned in 1884.

The two railways created temporary space for passengers in their freight sheds, and in September 1885 contracted with Heitsch and Son of Pontiac to construct a new depot and baggage room. Construction began in October and was complete in February 1886. The depot served passengers on the two lines and their successors until 1964, when the Grand Trunk Western Railroad ceased passenger operations through Holly. It was later used as storage by the railroad, and in 1998 the village of Holly purchased the building. It has since been restored. As of 2018, the depot may be moved to another location.

The Holly Union Depot is a long, single story cross-gable-roof structure made from reddish-orange and yellow-buff brick on a stone foundation. It has broadly overhanging eaves supported by open triangular timber brackets. Gabled projections are on each long side; these once contained separate ticket offices for the two railways. A rectangular carved
stone plaque is set into the facade of each projection, containing the town name, HOLLY, in raised capital letters. The building is eighty-two feet ten inches long and twenty-two feet four inches wide.

2003 Fiordland earthquake

The 2003 Fiordland earthquake struck the remote region of Fiordland in the South Island of New Zealand on 22 August 2003 at 0.12 am. The epicentre was 12 km deep, and was thought to be near Secretary Island at the entrance to Doubtful Sound. This was the same location as an earthquake of 6.7 Ms magnitude in 10 August 1993. 

At 7.2 Ms magnitude it was one of the largest quakes in the country for some time, and was the largest shallow quake since the 1968 Inangahua earthquake. There was an aftershock two hours later at 2.12 am, followed over several days by frequent small tremors; up to 21 September there were 6365 aftershocks. 

Fiordland is one of the seismically active parts of the country according to GNS seismologist Dr Warwick Smith, as they are a relief mechanism for stresses as the Australian and Pacific tectonic plates are being forced together in the area, with the Pacific Plate subducting under the Australian Plate.

In August 2004 there was another large earthquake of magnitude 7.1 Mw in Fiordland. 

At Te Anau some 70 km to the south-east residents felt the quake strongly and items fell off shelves in shops and homes. Some of the pupils at Te Anau Primary School felt "weird" or "scared". 

A team of geologists led by Ian Turnbull went to investigate and reported "landsliding on a large scale". They recorded at least 200 landslides after overflying seventy percent of central and western Fiordland.

Robert Smith (trade unionist)

Robert Smith (1862 – December 1934) was a Scottish trade union leader.

Smith worked as a coal miner in Kilwinning, Ayrshire, and became active in the Ayrshire Miners' Union (AMU). He became a full-time agent for the union and became its president in 1908, serving for many years.

Smith also became politically active, representing the Labour Party and becoming Provost of Kilwinning. At the 1918 UK general election, he stood in Bute and Northern Ayrshire, taking a distant second place with 28.5% of the vote.

The AMU was affiliated to the Scottish Mineworkers' Union (SMWU), and Smith was elected as secretary of the SMWU in 1918. He remained in the post until 1927, when he was defeated by William Allan, leader of the Lanarkshire Miners' County Union. Smith was also losing support in the AMU, perceived as being too right-wing, and members began calling for their officials to be subject to regular re-election. In 1928, members of the AMU voted Smith out of office, along with secretary James Brown and treasurer James Hood. Brown blamed the vote on agitation by members of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). However, a further vote a week later reinstated all three officials, on the condition that they put themselves up for periodic elections. By 1929, the CPGB was in decline, and Smith was again elected as secretary of the SWMU.

Smith also served on the executive of the national Miners' Federation of Great Britain in 1923 and 1930. He died late in 1934, at the age of 72.

Tubulins, which are components of the microtubule, have never been observed in Gracilicutes before. 

Most bacteria have a homologous structure, FtsZ. Prosthecobacter are the exception to this, containing genes that have higher sequence-homology to eukaryotic tubulin than FtsZ. 

These genes are called bacterial tubulin a (BtubA) and bacterial tubulin b (BtubB). The properties are not exactly same. However, surface loops and microtubules are extremely similar.

The Costume of Yorkshire

The Costume of Yorkshire is an 1814 book by George Walker illustrating the various styles of dress worn by people of differing traditional professions in the county of Yorkshire in the 19th century.

George Walker was born in 1781 near Leeds, the youngest of five brothers; his father William was a drysalter and a member of the Mill Hill Chapel. George was educated in Mansfield and then at the Revd. Charles Wellbeloved's school in York. Instead of following his father's trade, he studied natural history and fine art, often making sketches of wildlife, people and landscapes. He died in 1856.

The book contains an unnumbered frontispiece and 40 coloured and numbered engravings, including such famous pictures as those of Yorkshire cloth-dressers, making oatcakes, a woman spinning, and a collier. The text with each plate is in both French and English, an unusual feature given that the two countries had been at war for much of the period. Walker's paintings were engraved by the Havell family, including the engravers Robert Havell (1769-1832) and his cousin Daniel Havell (1786-1822): plates 1-24 by both men, the rest, later, by Robert Havell alone. Robert's son, also called Robert, engraved John James Audubon's "Birds of America". The print of the Middleton collier has been used as an image of the English working class at its inception in the industrial revolution.
